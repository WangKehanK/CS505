Gonna do these tomorrrrowww got distracted today &gt;w&gt;
Gonna doodle when I get home, drop refs please! preferably folks I haven't drawn for yet &lt;:
@HikariDana You and @MononymousGoat need to do an art trade and share OCs cause I feel like y'all would love each others characters so much
@Esai2005 @quaint_ms it's true i hate it   not cause of how it looks but because i drew him fanart once and he said "thanks i guess lmao"  fucking asshole
Getting closer to a werewolf Drew design I like! Also reposting the Raine page I did earlier cause her hair was a bit too dark to see the color split, what do ya'll think? Is it visible to you guys? (the bottom half of her hair splatters into a darker black) https://t.co/ssEqRw9b8j
Raine in her late teens / early 20s &lt;: https://t.co/gpRaZUs6wY
@RayStarKitty Be sure to take a Tylenol every four hours!! It is great that it's one shot but I've heard it gives big fevers!
Ooooohhhh https://t.co/SYnyNGp0wf

@MoonCritterArts @xMaryHellfire @TerraTheET Awwwwwe!! They look like very good friends 💕
I bought this shirt specifically to change into after service but I didn't notice the design is on the BACK 🙄  Luckily modern problems call for modern solutions! https://t.co/s0xDXXwHVf

Happy Easter everyone! ^_^ 🐇✝️🐣 https://t.co/OmSFM97l3A
@bluedigitalcat haha no that's what I call the pandemic cause I am tired of the word "pandemic" xD THAT's how over it I am!
safe and comfy  It's the night before Easter, yay! I love Easter because it's a time that signifies hope, rebirth and new beginnings, after getting my vaccine I'm so sure the panini is close to ending and I feel really excited about getting to see my family / friends again ^_^ https://t.co/gsKOC12Ayc

@AnnaKitsun3 @starcorg Curly tail! Very important
@Aredy_Redler Pebble 🥺💕
@GummiPup @dhewolf I'm so sorry you went through the same thing, I absolutely love your sona and all her colors, your art is amazing too, they're really missing out!
@dhewolf Honestly yeah, worst thing that happened is when I had a pal for months on Telegram and when I met him at MFF he got sooo angry with me for being a woman and never talked to me after that ;_; Luckily I still have lots of fur friends locally but I hear it's much harder for others
@Werewolf_Silver @dhewolf Thank you! She's a werewolf too ^ ^
@Skylerthehusky I know many!
I have very few interests but the ones I have are super obsessive, I'm an extrovert but I get social anxiety and have trouble reading tone / intention, I do repeative movements (arm swaying) so it's definately possible and finding out is gonna be a huge chip off my shoulder
I'm really glad we've changed it to #AutismAcceptanceMonth rather than awareness, many teachers / counselors / autistic friends have thought I'm autistic but being a black woman it's way harder for me to get diagnosed, now that I'm an adult I'm gonna look into it myself ^ ^
Happy #fursuitfriday !   We https://t.co/Wde8Nqj7WY
@dhewolf I should also add in that my fursona looks like this and on Telegram I'll get lots of comments about "you're a girl?? Oh... you should add like, eyelashes or something onto her so people can tell" and then they don't talk to me anymore LMAO https://t.co/JLm0odhCsr
I'm really glad someone made this thread, it's such a weird thing to /have/ to say but... you can be friends with people you can not / don't have sex with...? https://t.co/DQzY5HdksN
@BlueBuster7 @madjackrabbit Funny weed number
@dhewolf Gay men ghosting women at completely nonsexual public furmeets is SUCH a huge issue in the fandom, went to a bowling meet in my local community and they all clapped for each other but went completely silent when I went up 😨
@RedRiceShep OH ITS JERMAINE  I FORGOT IT WAS APRIL FOOLS I WAS 0.2 SECONDS AWAY FROM BLOCKING YOU

@kriqqit OKAY ILL TRY
WAIT  IM SCARED OF NEEDLES  AAAAAA
I've gained a lot new mutuals recently and I just want y'all to know I think your art / characters are all super cool 👉👈 I'm just a lil shy on Twitter cause I'm a newer to using it ^ ^; I really wanna do some doodles for y'all when I have time
Oh man... in less than a few hours I'm gonna punch Covid in the face (💉)
hmm anyone else have parents / a parent who refused to buy them anything or take them anywhere because it was "a waste of money" so as an adult you buy yourself all the things you always wanted as a child but with your adult money
Happy #TransDayOfVisibility !! Please give my best friend @Gh000zt a follow, he's super cool and makes arts, and crafts and posts awesome obscure animation / shows on his Tik Tok!! https://t.co/aixQ9oyFXs

@MarshiMelli So there I was  Arby's sauce on my
@HikariDana ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY?! BRO HAPPY BIRTHDAY
@47_cartoon @2fort_dook I'd like to know to
Me and her are both 23 so we grew up with the exact same generation, generation 1, and most of these are from that gen! She's also got some playhouses in storage (all of which I owned!!!) I'll be getting as well, I am literally so happy I can't even handle it!!
So on my Facebook I was expressing how much I missed my LPS toys / playhouses and my bestie @Buttonsthehedge gifted me the entirety of her LPS collection (minus her favorites!) and I am so overwhelmed with joy I almost cried 😭 There are so many in here I had been looking for!! https://t.co/2nsaJ1xEOO
@MoonCritterArts Ohh!! How was it! I'm excited / kinda nervous ngllll
@AnnaKitsun3 @Burnin_Dove That background is really impressive!
