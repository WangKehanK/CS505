@Leelee_98_Hern A monster
@ellie_bodilyy Oh I’m so sorry sweetheart 💕 my love to you and your family
@caroluscubanus I do see your point. I am very sorry. I thought I was only just standing up for my friend. I in no means meant to diminish the importance of your cultural views through any of this. I am very sorry.
@caroluscubanus The person in question quoted this same post last night and woke up to your tweet this morning. It hurt them because it seems quite pointed. I’m standing up for them because they’re very hurt.
@caroluscubanus Instead of subtweeting about someone who is badly hurting, let them hurt and cope in their own way. If you don’t wanna see it, remove them/mute them. This tweet you made hurt someone very badly.
holy crap...im really going to miss my store and my coworkers...
@LetaMarcellus I remember hearing who all was in it and immediately thought “OH THIS IS A SANGIN GROUP”
