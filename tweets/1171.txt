@_emilyhayes23 @THEAJHOLLYWOOD We had a guy from my school like this he always kept trying to stay in contact with me even though we barely talked in school and he ended up killing another one of our classmates after graduating. People are fucked up😩

I’ve been working my butt off for 7 months in the gym trying to get rid of the baby weight, I still have a lot more progress to go but I’m finally starting to feel more confident and beautiful again! I’m absolutely loving my new festie fits ✨💗 https://t.co/JS268gPvvl
Outside wow I suck 😅
Just any local day picking up marijuana at the dispensary and a mother with her daughter is selling Girl Scout cookies outfit the shop My exact thoughts: https://t.co/vHLe0iLHHY
@afterglowandco People are trying to cancel Dr Suess, just like everything else because they have nothing better to do with their lives I guess. It’s just an example of one of many things people are getting butt hurt over.
“Let’s cancel Dr Seuss”  “Now let’s go after Eminem” Do you all not have better things to do in your lives than spread this toxic cancel culture? People are so sensitive today I swear 😅
😂😂 I have three Mr Wobbles I feel better knowing someone else is just as obsessed lmfao https://t.co/pP29XvCYAd
@GanjaWhiteNight for the win 🔥 https://t.co/46MLjJz9FW
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like a bad bitch after their workout at the gym?
Gimme them wobbles 😩👏🏼 https://t.co/O9AlRJH9zi https://t.co/vhrD2u3Yu8
@karliemichelle as a mother to, I refuse to go to any events where they’re not taking the precautions and wearing mask. I went to a couple drive ins in Chicago and honestly I’m all for those. But an actual festival? It’s way too risky.
@princessjjelly I know wobble rocks is also in Denver but still it’s a smaller event and it got postponed
@princessjjelly They just postponed wobble rocks ain’t no way this is gonna happen if that’s not.
@karliemichelle Honestly a little disappointed in Pasquale for allowing this to tbh. As much as I’m all for bringing back festivals we need to get over this pandemic first, or at least wait till everyone is vaccinated for quite some time.
Has anyone else seen that insomniac is pulling off an actual fest for this year? 😳 tbh I don’t know how I feel about this, I still feel it’s way too soon for an event like this to happen. https://t.co/rrorLUYXRb
@KonixCSGO I got one on my wrist, not sure how big you planned on getting but honestly it wasn’t bad! It may sting a bit where your veins are, at least for me it did. Ribs are what really stun the most
@RollingLoud I think you’re mad pressed because he’s not wrong. 🐸☕️
Mine was @ILLENIUM 🥲💗 https://t.co/c5uyhWqA6d
How I’m feeling right now 🥲 obviously we are nowhere near ready to have full capacity events I’m just a lil sad. Can’t wait to wobble in November 🧠🌱♥️ https://t.co/JUMg9j0AaE
@_emilyhayes23 I know I’m already dreading it to dude. 🥲
I knew it was gonna happen but now it’s gonna be FREEZING 😅🥲 https://t.co/MPyUf3BzAQ

@_amberjeffers My friend has been hooping for 5 years and she said it took her two years to get down the wedgie as well! It’s definitely not easy. I’m just excited of what I’ve been able to pick up these last 6 months 🥰♥️
I’ve been hooping for 6 months now, this morning I got up, drank some coffee, &amp; worked on moves I’ve been trying to get down. Within the first go I instantly get the chest rolls down! 😂 I’ve been trying to do this for MONTHS. Now if I could only do this with the wedgie..🤔
