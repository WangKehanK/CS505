Or I don’t eat anything but one meal and restrict that. But like that doesn’t matter when your BMI is higher.
I’ve lost 30 pounds since September and my doctor asked me what I’ve been doing and I’m like “I just don’t eat that much” and it’s like not a question or cause of concern because I’m not skinny apparently. Like ?? “I just don’t eat that much” could mean I don’t eat as many snacks
@katcaIs 23 in September and going on 15 years
TW TW TW TW TW  TW TW TW TW TW   When my parents die and my cat dies, I’m going to kill myself because there’s no point. I’m only living for them and when they’re gone, I’m gone too.
I don’t even know what to do. I’m so upset. This isn’t fair.
I can’t fucking sleep. My heart hurts so bad.
My heart is fully and completely and utterly broken. From the depths of my actual soul. Truly I am in so much mental pain.
I am sad. I am so FUCKING sad. I wish people would understand the severe impact they have when it comes to their actions and words. The manipulation is so real and so toxic. I want to actually disintegrate off the planet.
The pure and utter mental destruction that I am going through at the moment is literally tearing through my chest. I have the biggest lump in my throat and I can’t stop crying. The internal conflict is actually killing me.
TW TW TW TW   I might actually kill myself if trump is elected this November and it’s not a joke, I’m fucking serious. I can’t imagine living another 4 years in turmoil and sadness over the hatred this president has caused
@gaunttgoddess Oh my god that’s awful. I was obsessed with this show fat camp and I wanted to be on it SO bad... in other news, you should’ve punched the mother🥺
Every single day I feel myself deteriorating a little more
I am so jealous (and proud) of people who come out to their families in creative ways. Like I just want it to be known so I don’t feel like I’m constantly hiding a part of myself.
I was 4-10, 13, 16, and 19 https://t.co/Y9BggvCG8X
I look back at this pic now and I would give anything to look like this again. I thought I was the ugliest fattest piece of shit... I was wrong. I’m the ugliest fattest piece of shit now. https://t.co/bTrjMSESmQ
I still posted the post I just deleted my caption
A club that I went to for my very first ever pride painted a giant mural of George Floyd on the side and I was sharing it on Facebook and said that I loved it and that it was the place where I attended my very first pride but then remembered im not ou and couldn’t post it 😅
Getting in fights on my personal with people about adele is my only identity rn
@starvinganafly I was doing great and now I’m spiraling
I’m crumbling
Plus they still have an income during this pandemic unlike a majority of America. Check. Your. Privilege. Mental health is serious and not everyone can afford therapy. We are human and need social interaction and meaningful contact and conversation.
I could go for free every other session and it still was too expensive. Most people can’t afford therapy. Check your mother fucking privilege at the door. Not everyone has rich parents who give you an allowance at 45 years old.
This pissed me the fuck off. I have multiple mental illness diagnoses and was in therapy for 3 years. It was the only thing that kept me from killing myself and insurance didn’t pay for it. My dad went $8,000 in debt trying to pay for it and my therapist even made it so (c)
So I was talking to the person I work for about how quarantine is killing people with mental illness. People are taking their lives everyday because of the isolation and she was like “well then they should get help, I’m in online therapy actually and love it”. (Continued) 👇🏻
@eatcelestineeat Bahahahaha she forgot Lana tho 😂
@dietcalz Exactly. And if you’re in school and claim that on your taxes as well then that should be enough to give you a stimulus
@dietcalz I had the same thing happen. I was only claimed because of insurance. I filed taxes and claimed I payed for everything and still didn’t get one. I really could’ve used it for school as well.

Do you even have an ED if you don’t wake up at 4am out of a dead depression sleep to have extreme anxiety over your body and weight for 3 hours??
Okay but Lana predicted quarantine by writing the song “the greatest” can she predict when I’ll be skinny?
Also who else in the world can make smoking look so beautiful? No one. Only LDR can.
I’m okay I’m just going crazy.
The suicide references in summertime sadness music video is... triggering.
Pls ignore all these tweets
The young and beautiful music video makes me want to die but also I’m turned on by her SO much???
I hate that LDR’s music makes me feel this way because I love her endlessly. I’m not going to stop listening to her though. She breathes life to me.
My tweets are sounding rash but it’s the truth. Lana Del reys music brings out the demons in me.
I’m sorry it’s 1:30am, I’ve been in my house for 42 days straight and all I’ve done is think about how much I hate myself every minute of everyday so now I’m gonna do something about it because I literally can’t live like this.
I want my physical appearance to scream “I’m Lana Del reys saddest music” aka deathly thin, vintage, and beautiful with an alcohol bottle in my hand.
Brb gonna start drinking Diet Coke and delete DoorDash from phone.
And it’s not her fault. Im not blaming her at all. This is just how my brain is processing it and it’s bad. It’s really bad.
Okay. Lana and her music makes me want to starve myself till I’m weightless. Drink till my liver gives out and get so high that I see god. I love her endlessly but music should not make me feel this way.
Hi I’m UGLY nice to meet you
@coffeencalories I honestly think I’ll need to be hospitalized when my cat dies. He’s been my best friend for the past 16 years and has got me through literally everything. I know I won’t make it out alive if I’m not hospitalized so it’s okay to cry and take it hard. It’s a family member.
My depression is cured knowing if I get corona I might die since my immune system is shit and I just spent multiple days in Disney. 😂✌🏻
Gonna go back through and count alcohol references. I fucked up not doing that the first time 🤦🏻‍♀️
Spiraling is going through lanas entire discography and counting and quoting all the times she references drugs.. 28. 28 times she references drugs.
Listening to gods and monsters and it reminded me of that one time I went off about god in English class for literally 5 minutes and my teacher looked at me like “you went to catholic school and have a nun aunt and your gonna act like that” 😂😂😂😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️
If Lana Del Rey could just say “it feels like heaven to him” in my ear for the rest of my life I would never be sad again
@CAITCOPING Tweet whatever you want and fuck what everyone else thinks. It’s your vent acc and you made it for this exact reason. Block people if you have to. People act like EDs aren’t a form of self harm or addiction but they are.
I think I’m unpredictable but really I’m just a confused calculator. https://t.co/sosgJe0nY8
Does anyone else randomly get extreme pain in their joints and then they just give out and you almost fall on your face? Just me? Okay. https://t.co/nUMS3WpHTC
I also free hand carve and paint pumpkins lmao https://t.co/QaSzUFuAZh
I’m late but I handmade my halloween costume a few years ago and I’m really proud of it #EDTWTTALENTSHOW https://t.co/Wf9242PcdK

@skinnyglossier Rosalia because you look like a tiny fairy 🧚‍♂️   “In Latin, the Rosalia was a festival of roses celebrated variously throughout the Roman Empire.”
My mom doesn’t like Lana Del Rey and I think I need to move out

@losinglbsx Idk why but Brazilian Portuguese
It's alarming truly how disarming you can be Eating soft ice cream, Coney Island queen She says, "You don't want to be like me Looking for fun, getting high for free I'm dying, I'm dying
Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem  Lying to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf  It's alarming honestly how charming she can be  Fooling everyone, telling how she's having fun She says you don't want to be like me  Don't wanna see all the things I've seen I'm dying
2018 and 2019 were hella hard years working on recovery and here we are. 2020 hella hard relapsing all because of the pressures society has during the new year “new decade’ 🙄🙄
@cocktailcals Just added, my username is runtodive
@imperfectIy_ It also syncs up to MFP which makes life easier
@imperfectIy_ I have the fitbit Alta hr and I love it honestly
@eatcelestineeat My mom called me to ask how it went and I was like “I can’t talk I’m gonna die without water” 😂😂
@eatcelestineeat Because I went to the turtle hospital without any water and the only thing I drank was coffee beforehand so I was literally dying the entire time and by the end I was getting really anxious cause my mouth was SO dry I thought I was gonna die. Dramatic I know.
Why am I such a fucking idiot lmao
@annetakesover Yikes https://t.co/xKbF3MB6uT

@XSkeletonGirlX Thank you love!!! I should be able to eat all of those. I have a severe dairy intolerance and can’t have dairy but if it’s traces of dairy that “may” or may not be in there that’s okay. I am going to search up the breakfast bars to see if I can find them here. Thank you!!
@imperfectIy_ 😇
@XSkeletonGirlX 3 questions.   1. do you live in America (asking cause I wanna try some of these things if you are)  2. Is everything vegan? 3. If it’s not all vegan do the sunrise breakfast bars have dairy in them?
Do you ever just try to lie about being okay but forget how to act and not be convincing at all cause same and fuck lol
@himynameisana_ And honestly it’s rude af to waste peoples time like that cause if I really was there I would’ve been sitting in my car for over 20 minutes waiting... which has happened multiple times before. It’s obnoxious.
@himynameisana_ Your tweets keep popping up on my feed and I’m not mad about it lmao. I am 100% the same way. I get THE WORST anxiety over it. My best friend is literally so slow and non chalant. I text him “here” 20 minutes before I get there and he’s still not ready when I actually get there
I’m in online college and terms are only 5 weeks long and this biology class is stressing me the fuck out and it’s only the second day of the first week. There is SO MUCH to do I’m seriously no time and honestly how people work full time and college and still get good grades idk
@himynameisana_ private jet to personally give a pair of yeezys to DJ Khalid who ALSO took a private jet to meet Kanye there. What the fuck.
@himynameisana_ Holy shit this is the most woke tweet I’ve seen in awhile. You are 100% correct and also they need to stop pretending like they care about the environment when they literally use personal jets to fly all over the world literally every day. I saw a thing about Kanye taking a
@ktkals I’ve never used a filter on a bowl
@msperfectlyfine Honestly who cares hahha I’m originally from Maine and it’s literally a meme because so many Mainers drink iced coffee in the dead of winter

One time my therapist tried to take credit for me stopping purging and that’s honestly hilarious because I stopped purging before I even started seeing her lmao I think she just needed to feel successful about something because I was a shit that didn’t listen to her ever lol
@sad_bby_grl That’s your uterus bb
