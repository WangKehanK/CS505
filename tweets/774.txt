@TruthSeiker @GMA @Ginger_Zee It’s odd that you’re going after the meteorologist for infrastructure failures.
@TiffanyCosplay I just recently bought that 45 cutter. Love it.

@AmakaUbakaTV @BostonChildrens "Treating and caring for patients with SMA can cost up to .... $6 million in the first 10 years of a patient's life," - Dave Lennon, president of Novartis Gene Therapies. So effing what Dave, doesn’t mean you charge 2 million to save a little girl. Dave’s a douche.
@AmakaUbakaTV The email address kills me.
@NicolleDWallace @Timodc Oh please tell me there’s a @Lesdoggg commentary coming.
@BethFreemanArt Listen, I don’t want to tell you how to do things, but shouldn’t this be onlyyams content?
@VogtForNH @ProgressivesNH @SenDavidWatters I’m in the same boat, buying a new car in the next two weeks. I would love to buy an EV, but price is too high for me. I get tax credits and what not, but that’s not the immediate help I need. Until the price comes down there are always going to buts.
@theCHIVE Middle Aged is 50, jag off.
@adamxii Suck it Freddy T
@Off__Earth And I thought Twitter didn’t allow pornography.
@benjaminjroy @adamxii @ChachiBeatles I hope you never text STOP back.
@ValaAfshar @lizandmollie @RexChapman This is not a reality for most of Americans. Must be nice if this applies to you. Stupid effing pie chart.
@adamxii Are you sure it not just a PornHub category?
@TraceySkinner4 @GovChrisSununu Shut up Tracey
@Wino Love the fact that you live here.
@CIAspygirl Here’s the start of the narrative
@TiffanyCosplay @KINGDOMHEARTS Thanks for the tip, my main concern was the plastidip peeling off.
@TiffanyCosplay @KINGDOMHEARTS You don’t foam the pvc?
@adamxii I don’t get all of this at all, you want kids back and teachers want to be safe. Give educators the gd vaccine. This is absolutely so easy to solve. My lady is in education and watching all the school board meetings where I live is infuriating.
@halhickel Not a popular opinion, but my favorite movie.
@nancywestnews Have any Republican members raised any concerns? Also if the Rs wanna go to shin dings they should let the Ds go remote.
@georgehahn Happy Trail Boss
@KimberDin I like finding sea glass.
@allyssooonnnn Are you also your biggest critic? I am super critical of myself, but I also am super proud of myself when I nail something. I think the 2 go hand and hand. Please post more pics of that gorgeous red brick wall you have.
@orbital_knight when is Spire Blast gonna be updated? I’m dying.
@Mads_five Can not wait for more WIP photos
@Hardy_SXM Breaking Bad
@allyssooonnnn Yeah you might be cute, but that brick wall is sexy af.
@Ginger_Zee Looked good this morning, but was way better at night.
@Marc_Bertrand Oh yeah Comcast never increases fees.
@JosiePinto “ I’m prepared to go forward with it “ 😂😂😂
@NAMI_NH I live on the seacoast, could have used this link a year ago. My teenage son waited for 3 days in an E.D. for an open spot. It was beyond infuriating.
@adamxii I found this after I watched the American remake. So good, and definitely recommend the book.
@joshwurster_ You know earlier I was like, man that Josh Wurster always wears nice suits. I take it back.
@NialaBoodhoo the first non mind blowing week of the year 😂😂
@adamxii Preach!!!
@JosiePinto @RepNicoleK Again, Thank you.
@RepNicoleK @JosiePinto Sorry for asking so many ?s, I don’t get out much. Why can’t this be a ballot question?
@RepNicoleK @JosiePinto Thank you
@JosiePinto Coming to this thread late, what’s the reasoning to retain?
@halhickel @PsychoGoreman We are so watching this for Friday Night movie this week! Thanks for sharing!
@senatorjohn Isn’t waiting room for relievers?
@BLMManchesterNH @JFastcatz
@lizzieohreally Did you get the Jem jacket also?!?
@Ridd1e It was his comment, not a gif. Grown men should know better.
@10mm_404 @Ridd1e WTF is wrong with you?!?
@ed_solomon *Suspected serial killer
@Alex_cosplay @FoodAndCosplay @StellaChuuuuu Damn that’s clean, like really clean.
@rachelbonnetta Dude looks like an Adam Levine and Drake love child.
@chatham58 I hate you right now
10 years on this, and I have 84 followers which are mostly Russian sex bots. I also almost never tweet. So I guess you do get what you put out.
Catching up on @americangodsus and bam @evanjstern nice little surprise. https://t.co/yuq5rb73d9
@BobbyDukeArts Sir I do not know who you are, but this tweet made me follow.
@julianamazzatv And someone just became my favorite morning anchor.
@Wino Come back in warm weather and no pandemic.
@ManMadeMoon ....and here I am. 😂😂😂
@EmmaTolkin Too good
@JaisolWX @7News Unsolicited viewer idea #837. @joshwurster_ does the wash your car graphic. Can we get a walk the dog graphic?
@nancywestnews What would a settlement look like?
@therealelp baby Pygmy Hippo https://t.co/ycggQJKER3
@namaste6563 @bessbell These are the tweets I’m here for.
@therealelp you gotta google baby pygmy hippo.
@TiffanyCosplay @assassinscreed @iwata_airbrush @Ubisoft Is there a build video?
@danagould Well looks like I’m following @danagould
@marshallhook 🎶🎵Everyone’s angry in Brookline🎵🎶
@Chrissie_Zullo look what I found in the wild! https://t.co/5VgMyDZ5Wk
@marshallhook, I really enjoy you on @985TheSportsHub. I also feel bad that @FredToucher constantly makes uncomfortable comments. You took them all like a champ!
@TaikaWaititi were is We’re Wolves?
@chinbeard Trying to get this done before Xmas for my brother in law. https://t.co/ALZWcQKvKx
@Johnston985 Thank god
@CatherinVaritek And this is why I follow.
@Johnston985 The fact that you know what to do says a lot.
@Marc_Bertrand Is Jake on Twitter? I need to follow him!
@julianamazzatv @7News @AmakaUbakaTV @acrawfordtv @clamberton7 @marshallhook @deskon7 @koreyobrienTV @Mr_Brown324 @HardwoodJournal @marshallhook is 100% right. It’s made with powdered potatoes.
@adamxii Minor league baseball is the only baseball I can take the family to because I can not afford to bring them to Fenway. The way every club treated their affiliates at the beginning of 2020 was indefensible. No surprise they’ve been losing fans.
@SueNBCBoston Yup
@Patriots @Bose @Toucherandrich
@AmakaUbakaTV Not yet.  But my weekday anchor on the weekend makes me think I’m late for work.  Scared me briefly this morning.
@A_Dixie_Girl @adamxii was wondering if you saw this, reminds me of 90s New York Hardcore. Most notably Burn “Shall be Judge”.....
@caramooney You are on to something. I think high school pond hockey should be something for schools to look into.
@GinaMBenitez @GioBenitez @AlanRHooper Just saw Gina on the Boston affiliate @7News and spent the last 10 minutes researching if Gio and Gina were related...this tweet is a dream breaker.
@mariapz1974 Congrats and enjoy your day!
@edewittNH So I guess we’ll get some numbers after Durham.
Hey, @emorwee you’re on @1a!!!
@chatham58 But what would you “sing”
@Kay_Breezy22 https://t.co/isUnlTmsAQ
@rennycushing congratulations on being Minority Leader!!!
@Wino @ZoandBertrand @hardy985 @985TheSportsHub  The best radio spot of all time!!!!
@SueNBCBoston Only if you reached into it on air to pull something random out.
@ManMadeMoon What kind of discounts are we talking about? Also not sure if I can even skate anymore, can I bring my kid’s Razor Scooter?
Gonna ask my trump voting parents for aviator glasses for Christmas.
@Kay_Breezy22 How does a conference championship even work at that point?!?
@caramooney Why do ALL sports writers love The Boss?
@Johnston985 @JimGrayOfficial @IAmJamesStewart Please for the love, let Fred see this.
@kaniehtiio That’s cool as hell.
@SueNBCBoston just tuned in on @NECN. I’ve never seen you before but, I already like you a lot. Who’s got 2 thumbs and is a new fan...you got it, this guy!
@CMStayPositive @ABC 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I switched to @WCVB as soon as they said they were staying with him.
@adamxii Yeah, then you eat it on air. Meanwhile I’m eating gas station pizza.🤬
