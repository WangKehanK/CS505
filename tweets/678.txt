@whereissk Episode 1: The Killing Fields of Tx
@whereissk “A true crime team travel the US in search of cases while visiting local eateries and getting a real taste for where these violent delights had their violent ends.”
@whereissk We could honestly be pioneers like imagine a good network spin off
@whereissk I’m 100% down to cook Murder food, or even, make food from famous final meals by serial killers???
@whereissk Yes absolutely I’m 100% down, we can call it Violent Delights and our tag line can be “These violent delights, have violent ends.” Like...cmon that’s gold.
@whereissk What if we teamed up to do a podcast where we talk about true crime while making famous food from the place where it happened?? Food plus Murder is always a good combo??

I think the title is something about a Requiem? Idk I felt that word was important somehow??
The book would of course be gorey to an extent. The opening scene is very bloody, and there are crime scenes and chapters that detail the murders. I think it’s important to give the killers POV as well as our main protagonist’s as well. It makes it so much more spine tingling
I haven’t decided if this has a magical aspect to it yet but I do know that I want the character to not have a love interest arc. I feel like this isn’t the book for that. She has to find herself first and that’s what the books focus on.
The book would expand into two more novels to complete a trilogy of coming to terms with ones trauma and survivors guilt while also processing feelings of revenge and the strength it takes to live life after trauma
She realizes that the killer is the same one that left her the lone survivor of her class, and he’s back to finish the job. She teams up with a crime club in order to understand what’s happening all the while keeping her identity a secret from them.
The book starts off as a flashback of that night, and picks up on the three year anniversary of the Landcaster High Massacre. Several students have started to go missing in the last few months but our main character finds that one thing links them together
I have a book idea about a lone survivor of a prom night massacre who is now in college and has to team up with a crime podcast club on campus to help catch the serial killer that murdered her classmates after he resurfaced. Very Veronica Mars meets Scooby gang.
Gen-Z has done the Hanson Middle part trend now I need them to bring back JNCO jeans so can live out the late 90s early 2000s goth fantasy. Hurry up guys I’m almost 30

In honor of #AutismAcceptanceMonth I would urge you to read about how girls are less likely to be diagnosed with autism because they because they don’t fit autistic stereotypes and they mask symptoms better than boys do.
