I'm fully vaccinated.
Getting my second shot today instead of Thursday. ðŸ’‰
@DrMcKinn I got one shot of the moderna  vaccine. Just a sore arm. Second shot on the 8th.
@BlizzardCS Only thing I couldn't do was update firmware on my modem but my cable company said it's up to date.
How? It was shown live.   https://t.co/aLI6EFljPq
@BlizzardCS Yeah did all the steps listed plus some stuff found on youtube
@Rachelmoor29 South Carolina
@BlizzardCS I sent a ticket in but wanted to see if this is a problem for lots of people right now.
Does anyone else live in a conservative town and have family that are hardcore conservatives?  It's depressing at times.
Almost everyone I served with is a trump/ GOP lover. I somehow came out of the army as a liberal after going in conservative. ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²
@psychokitty78 I hope that's all I get. I am a baby when I get sick lol
I get my second shot Thursday and to be honest I'm not looking forward to the side effects I've been hearing about. ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
@JenaWantsA_Dab @FeministInfidel I did. Thanks
@FeministInfidel I need help getting followers. I've struggled for years
@BlizzardCS Wow
@BlizzardCS I keep getting the disconnected from server notice even though I've done all the trouble shooting
@misspiperwood I'm a very liberal person but I own one and yes I voted for Biden.
@4wding @misspiperwood The M-16 and M-4 are both 3 round burst not fully auto in the military.  I carried one for years during my service.
Tell South Carolina state legislators to pass the S.C. Compassionate Care Act this year! https://t.co/CxCgNGpWPh via @MarijuanaPolicy

@TallulahSC It drives me crazy
@TallulahSC My elderly parents refuse to get it because here in S.C. so much misinformation is going around
@Leslieoo7 Not at all but since he began running I've learned how our government works like never before. I tried hard to convince friends here in the south that Trump is a bad guy but they didn't care.
@ThatsJacqueline Me. I wasn't active for a while but I'm back
@TeaRoomBetty Hello. Democrat from S.C.
@SMoulden Also a veteran in a red state with a heart of Blue ðŸ’™. #BidenHarris2020
Can I get some more resistance followers? #Resist #follow #Resistance
I tweeted about a young unarmed girl being shot 5 times by Anderson S.C. Deputies. Will you please rt and get this story out there. #PoliceReform #BlackLivesMatter
â€œThe minor girl suffered injuries including a shattered tibia, and significant wounds to her feet, neck and back.Â She survived, but the mauling and gun-shot wounds have left her permanently disfigured and emotionally damaged".

In Anderson S.C. an unarmed16 year old Black girl was shot 5 times by the local sheriff's office after they released the dog (sheriff deputies killed their own dog but initially called the young girl a cop killer). Please share she deserves more attention.

@HaydenJordan19 @ResisterSis20 @LindaLeePeacock I am in South Carolina and I vote blue but feel like it's a useless vote each time. I still do it though.

@kfrancks Knives up! That's dangerous
@thomaskaine5 South Carolina seems to have different rules in different places. Where I live it's random sometimes places require mask some places don't. Bars and restaurants are open with no spacing. It's crazy
