@beingrealmac @Ecsullie Love him &amp; miss him so much!!
@atrupar not giving a shit that obtaining &amp; leaking someone's tax returns is illegal. So spare us pls your stupid fake outrage over a junkie.
@atrupar omg get over yourselves! Tucker &amp; Fox didn't steal anything. Y'all are pathetic &amp; giant hypocrites! If this were Don Jr. or Eric you'd be all over it. And you had no problem seizing upon Trump's leaked tax returns in 2017 when they magically turned up with Rachel Maddow,
@LilliSawyer17 This didn't happen during Trump's term. All these foreign leaders are pushing Biden &amp; probably seizing on the bullshit going on here so publicly as their opportunity to do nefarious shit thinking he won't notice or won't have the guts to do anything....
@LilliSawyer17 Okay, this is a real question, what fucking planet are we on? These people are nuts....
@DailyCaller There are no words to describe just how disgusting this entire thing is &amp; it's embarrassing how the media is rolling over for this family.
@DanCook26214426 @JoeBiden Pandering...
@PastTenseOvDig @BreitbartNews Probably has something to do with the recent stimulus package where he said that people who say they feel unsafe going back to their workplace bc of COVID can get unemployment.
@deenie7940 @pacificpundit3 omg This is an embarrassing mess...
So today Biden couldn't get a three letter acronym right, 'AFT' instead of 'ATF', as he continued to speak he also demonstrated that he gets off track just counting. He went through each point one, two, fourthly and THEN back to three.
@caroljsroth The jukebox lol
So Biden announces new head of ATF, but gets it wrong, twice &amp; says AFT.  https://t.co/GBf7L3mBoX
@guypbenson DeSantis is the the best Gov. we've ever had! Trump will always be our first choice, but if he chooses not to run DeSantis will be hard to give up, but he's been amazing for Florida &amp; could be great for America!
@OceanEyes50 Too late! They made this bed.....  and I find it funny too bc it's gonna get much worse 😜
Ok, so did I hear Biden call the ATF the AFT earlier when he spoke?
Anyone asking why the hell New York wants to give $15,600 checks to undocumented immigrants?
@CarlosSimancas 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I remember watching this that night &amp; I almost peed laughing! Tucker is hilarious most of the time, but this takes the cake. Best ever!
@mario_telly @thehill so he could receive classified info. Trump never disappeared while at his homes &amp; was always available. I don't think you need to go there with how much work Trump did vs Biden. Biden hardly has anything on his daily schedule, which has been reported on a lot.  He's weak &amp; lazy.
@mario_telly @thehill You have no idea what you are talking about, or you do &amp; are lying on purpose like Biden does.  Trump took his staff with him wherever he went, including to his homes, so he could always be on top of everything when he was out of the White House. He also had SCIFS installed t
@FoxNews NOBODY IS IN CHARGE OF THE BORDER. OUR COUNTRY IS A SITTING DUCK!

@markrugerman45 She's turned her back on Trump, so Romney can keep her.
@kayleighmcenany @OutnumberedFNC @FoxNews @RyannMcEnany 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Oh that's so sweet!!!
@OceanEyes50 Can't say the word, but it starts with a C.....
@RealMattCouch So Kellyanne, Newt &amp; Kudlow turned on Trump already?

@votesamuelwill1 AND ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!
@MrAndyNgo @neesietweets I don't understand something. If I went out of my house to any business, pulled out a hammer and nail and began hammering into the glass to break it I'd be handcuffed &amp; in jail by noon! Why are they being allowed to even get so far as breaking the glass?
@RichardGrenell @DLindsey2 I really hope you run for office soon!!
@vampyanji @amars50 I'm so glad you did! God I miss him!  Here is a President &amp; a strong leader who never had to turn to anyone for permission to speak. Pray we get him back 🙏💖
@chuckwoolery It's creepy listening to him. He made himself mad!! #AngryJoe
@KyleKashuv Acrylic nails are infrastructure.
@anangbhai @KyleKashuv 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Yes I think it is!
@DailyCaller So then she thinks it's a problem letting illegal immigrants into the U.S. without being tested or vaccinated?!?
I hate listening to this man.....
Biden is such a lying mother effer.....
@SHO_Shameless Frank, once you convince him the charger is yours and you need it back 😁
@rayl1975 Robbed?
Angry Joe is at it today!
@markrugerman45 omg Whenever he does that it makes me cringe. It's embarrassing...
@SenGillibrand that show Republicans agree with the stimulus package!
@SenGillibrand You should stop with this right now &amp; stop treating people like they are too stupid to know better. Everyone knows what infrastructure is regardless of this ridiculous attempt to make it mean other things.  And we also know what bipartisan means &amp; it IS NOT relying on polls
@SenGillibrand the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.
@cutler5051 We-fucked-ourselves-over-a-lie.  I'm pretty sure that's a word somewhere.....
Does Biden not realize how ridiculous he looks when he says over and over and over to wear a mask and socially distance when there are thousands upon thousands of kids &amp; adults squished together at the border?
Did Kamala Harris just say that we are going to soon go to war over water???
@Sailor_Kaalia @SaraCarterDC Nobody ever said that!! WTF is y'alls fascination with that? Literally no one has said that, you're just spreading this misguided narrative.
@lee_borden @deb6090 @JackPosobiec WHY? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY THEY WERE EVEN OFFERED THAT KIND OF PLEA? 13 &amp; 15 YR OLDS KNOW YOU CAN'T KILL PEOPLE OR STEAL FROM THEM. ONE WAS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT HER PHONE! HIS LIFE MATTERED &amp; THIS JUST DUMPED ALL OVER HIS FAMILY.
SO DID ANYONE ASK BIDEN ABOUT THE BORDER??
@DailyCaller Why can't the media call him out on this blatant lie? It's disgusting the way he keeps using segregation...
I hate listening to Biden.
Dear God Biden is depressing to listen to....
@cmclymer That's not true, why do you say that?
@RealDeanCain The first?!?? Good for you, it's about time!! Good luck, God speed and we will support you and hopefully will pave the way for more!! 🙏
@GOPChairwoman He will never do it bc he will never be pressed by the media. Kamala either. They aren't pressed about anything at all. We have absent leaders...
@jaf7 @GOPChairwoman Do your homework, you sound really stupid.
@WashTimes Wait, is it me or does the girl in this picture look a lot like Debbie from Shameless??
@WashTimes WHY DON'T THE MEDIA ACTUALLY ASK THIS OF THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF 'THE WHITE HOUSE '? CAN HE NOT SPEAK FOR HIMSELF?
@Pismo_B lol I hate these people....
@crazyclownT @SHO_Shameless @stevehowey @shanolahampton @IsidoraGore And I would love to see Fiona one last time, but doesn't look like that's gonna happen. I just hate that it's ending.  I love the hell out of all of them!!
@crazyclownT @SHO_Shameless @stevehowey @shanolahampton @IsidoraGore I don't think he's dead. I saw a clip of the last episode with him in hospital, but that doesn't mean he doesn't die there. I'm curious to see what he wrote in that letter and if there really is a gold brick buried in the backyard. lol I felt so bad for Lip, he's trying so hard..
@AZachParkinson on anything at all. Nor is Harris.
@AZachParkinson She is terrible at this &amp; her attitude sucks. She smirks every time Peter Ducey asks a question. She mocks him, and others. And she almost never gives a complete answer. Someday soon the media is going to have to make Biden answer questions for himself. He's not being challenged
@LisaMarieBoothe Eating crow I hear is hard for some. Especially if it's a big one....
@neontaster @benshapiro I'm sorry, but Florida welcomes all! We have a great Governor, 2 awesome Senators and the greatest former &amp; future President ever!! AND schools have been open all year as well as businesses. Plus there's the beaches...
@GovRonDeSantis @foxandfriends We are so proud to have you as our Governor! From the start by cancelling the heinous Common Core initiative, to your steady and strong handling of COVID here to vaccine distribution &amp; standing up to those (60 Minutes) who are out to hurt you politically. Thank you!
@TheLeoTerrell God love you Leo!! But we both know he'll never answer. If he does he'll have to concede that you are right, and he can't do that. No Democrat can bc then they won't have any real argument to talk about. God forbid they argue actual issues instead of emotions....
@TheLeoTerrell I miss him!!! But I can wait. Me &amp; my entire family support President Trump yesterday, today, tomorrow and in 2024!!!
@miles_commodore @deb6090 Outsiders - and yes, in a heartbeat!
@kaitlancollins He's milked this vaccine stuff enough. He deserves zero credit without admitting that we wouldn't be where we are today if it weren't for Operation.Warp Speed &amp; President Trump!
@AmieWohrer Me too! I hate it when conservatives accidentally get suspended!!
@DanCook26214426 Innocent
@jason_meister @Veteran4Trump Biden has too much baggage &amp; he's dragging it around with him everywhere. Messy issues. It seems like there is a new one each week. Biden's stupidity &amp; obvious cognitive issues, spraining his ankle, falling up stairs &amp; a dog that bites people and poops in the halls of the WH.
@RepMattGaetz  I could not be more proud that my three favorite politicians are also my representatives! President Trump, Gov. Desantis &amp; Rep. Gaetz! They have done this too many times &amp; they only have power when people cave &amp; let them roll right over everyone. Never give up!
@DanCook26214426 FUCK-TASTIC!
Two things. If it did, then WTF is the POTUS doing crunching into the mic and chewing while he's speaking to the entire fucking world? Now our President has no home training? If it didn't air, then that means it was edited, which also means it wasn't live, but pre-recorded. 😱😱
Ok, can somebody help me out here, did this really happen Friday morning? https://t.co/uORzprnN6Q
@megynkelly @kevindandy1 @marcorubio I concur..
@JasonMillerinDC lol Geez Louise look at the hateful responses!  They miss him too!! 😂
