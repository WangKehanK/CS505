The way some of y’all romanticize suicide or suicidal tendencies for likes and retweet’s is really disheartening
Joyner Lucas mad at Lil Nas X for seducing satan.....but has a song where ISIS seems to be the entire video an one where he has the most country ass white man mouthing the N-word with a hard R....corny ass fuck

How my wedding will have both limp Bizkit and playboi Carti played is heartwarming

@C_Rodz03 Top 5 DCEU definitely
@realglitterrboy It’s the writing and directing of his character lol it’s all so outlandish for no reason
Zack Snyder’s Justice league was good....but that’s it let’s calm down
@realglitterrboy Good cause it’s horrendous, it’s not his fault but it’s horrendous
Apparently Ben and Leto weren’t even in the Same room together when filming that justice league ending and that’s just hilarious
We really out here a while ass Firefighter/paramedic...sheeesh
Still crazy that you shitted yourself at a party lmao https://t.co/KIetPzozrO
The McRib is back baby
Not every movie can be fixed with a 4 hour version of it lmao that’s an important thing to know
Zack Snyder’s Justice League. A vast improvement over 2017s version. While flaws still exist with pacing and tone, characters are way more fleshed out and the film actually has a soul. The Vision was clear for Snyder and I’m happy he was able to get it out for fans and Autumn https://t.co/iJR2CSYV0C
@C_Rodz03 Shoot I wish I was too 🥺
No matter what....the DCEU as a whole is garbage
