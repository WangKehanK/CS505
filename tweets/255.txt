@Mike_Taylor1972 Got my license on a @Ford LTD wagon, aka ‘the banana boat’.    First car was a @chevrolet ‘77 Camaro - free car left at my old man’s repair shop for dead. Straight 6, ton of miles and beat.  Ended up putting a ton of $$ into it (at least for a teen)  Still want my first @Ferrari https://t.co/O7LoRRqwhX
@Eagles @Toyota This man’s got HEART! https://t.co/YsimjucytQ
Interesting https://t.co/5kiA8ZMYSx
@EllleDe Certainly get prices on at least 2 if not 3 dealers, and let them know you are. Not only will you get car pricing info, you will see who you prefer to do business with.   Like someone said, tell them you’re undecided on down pmt/trade/finance details. Get pricing on the car only.
@TihoBrkan OMG. Amazing Tiho. Truly an inspiration. Dream big!
@TihoBrkan Fully agree Tiho.  Cheers.
@Eagles @Toyota Sign this man for life. 💰💪😎
@TorreySmithWR On top of this, fist class guy and athlete. Nothing but respect for @JerryRice
Awesome. https://t.co/HH73HCmqjr
@DOITFORDOMB @fcoxx_91 This guy ☝️😎💰💪
@BrianDawkins Smart people learn from their mistakes. Brilliant people learn from the mistakes of others.
@Eagles That was a lot of fun with my coffee this am. ☕️ 30+ year @Eagles fan. Gotta say: @greengoblin needs to step up his tackle game. Even the sack on this clip was ugly. QB basically tripped on a yard marker. Focus on form and tackling, not image. Wrap. ‘Em. Up. Every. Time. Man.
@woodbrothers21 Great race Jon. Finish just doesn’t show it. Car was fast and crew did an awesome job. Good to understand what happened towards the end, so thanks for the post. Incredible to hang on with an old tire like that.  Big step in the right direction, things turning around.
Absolutely fascinating Tiho. Truly appreciate all of your posts. https://t.co/RJZVKBZ3bZ
@gtotoy I think gramma was a hockey player!
@gtotoy YO man, good to see you back! Speaking of which, how’s the back doing?  Haven’t read your blog, just first time noticing your posts. Cheers bud.
Dunno. That play was a big deal.  Being #1 seed &amp; also underdogs helped a lot as well. IMHO, it took some pressure off as they were not expected to make it anywhere. Had nothing to lose. That team just had confidence and something magical. Everyone stepped up. That play inspired. https://t.co/oYQPLd7JpQ
Great analogy! Rest In Peace doc. https://t.co/afv1m7BB67
Fun video and great to share with newer players.  Don’t think you did too bad tho. Yeah, the draft/rookie parties a bit excessive but gave back to your fam, got a couple of cars/condos. Gotta have wheels and gotta live somewhere! contract #2 and beyond for saving. Go get SB 2! https://t.co/HSEStROYZW
Picked up dinner sandwiches at #chapmansgeneralstore in Granville, NY tonight. Noticed this coat rack and the sign next to it. VERY KIND of them and gonna get cold this weekend. Owners are a super people. If in the area, stop by and grab some great eats!#SpreadTheWord https://t.co/0jVevJbVtw
@TihoBrkan My wife and I started making wine a couple of years ago. You ever make it to Vermont, bring the sardines and we will supply the wine! 🍷
@NorthmanTrader That is sooo 20th century.
@alexsingleton49 Congrats on your season, way to step up. I mostly appreciate your how you wrap up your tackles. It’s the simple things. Stay humble and disciplined.🦅
There is waaaay too much political drama here and have no time for it. I’m just here to converse with some friends, maybe learn a few things and get a few ideas. Thread just gets clogged with garbage. https://t.co/7v1jelwmpq
@barronjohn1946 This entire @barronjohn1946 thread is funny shit whether you like Trump or not. For what it’s worth, I don’t like politicians whatsoever, so don’t read into it too much. Just saying, funny shit.

@bespokeinvest @NFL Which one of them is Enron?
@TihoBrkan My daughters car. At least she found it!

Calgon take me away. https://t.co/6xyCwdMrYt
Ended up with 32”. 🥶
@biggercapital 30”-40” of fresh snow here in Vermont. Ever ski/snowboard here??
@TihoBrkan Yo!  Enjoy that Caribbean. 18” of snow up here in Vermont. Wish I was there...❄️☃️🥶🤕❄️☃️🤕🥶
@woodbrothers21 Congrats!  A tremendous honor and well deserved. 🎉 🏁
@chigrl Always love a good conspiracy theory. Whatcha thinking?
@PeterLBrandt Right?!?!

This guy👇 is a must follow for financial advice/freedom/success. Work hard and keep investing in yourself.  Couldn’t agree more.  Many kudos and cheers. 🍻 https://t.co/r6zJfKrA8z
@davidcoverdale Yes!  LOL. Bring back Monsters of Rock!!!
Sounds like you are living the dream Michael! 🏁 💰 Thanks for all your posts. 🍻 https://t.co/VIt735WHii
@TihoBrkan Very interesting post. Thanks for sharing.
@BillyonBass Right back atcha from #vermont @BillyonBass Thanks for all the great music through the years man. #mrbig https://t.co/V4hNKBCYzm
@OversoldS @biggercapital @SchlangDaddy @rago_carlo @adamfeuerstein 🍿
@TihoBrkan ABC’s would be my favorite (hard to pick one) but there are many Islands I haven’t been to yet...Anguilla being one of them. Vacation only or planning on investing there? Cheers either way. Enjoy and stay safe.
@TihoBrkan Snorkeled once between Manley and Shelly beaches in Nov (2011). Not much threat - pretty cold and didn’t swim very long at all! 😂 🥶 Just had to take a dip in the ocean while there!!  What a beautiful city. You have lived in remarkable places my friend. Bondi is amazing.
@TihoBrkan Put a 100+ year @NewEnglandSlate roof on it and never worry about re-roofing it again. 100% Natural stone quarried and hand-split in Vermont!  You’ll spend more upfront but can’t buy a better performing/looking roof.
@slateroof2 @PeteWard7 IMO, am absolutely gorgeous roof. Ingenious application.
👇This man is a legend. Live the dream Brotha! 🥂 https://t.co/UxwFOhK9B2
I need to start hanging out with this guy! 👇 Love the way you think.  Next time in Vermont, look me up. 🍻 https://t.co/zZ46o4YH2z
Terrible argument @maxkellerman but I guess that’s TV for ya. Open your eyes man. #thereplacements #therunningman https://t.co/MAV1d1ys6n
Although the tackle on @BoobieMilesXXIV clearly was NOT a horse collar, it looked like the effects of one in the way he came down. Can’t pinpoint exactly what happened to @ZERTZ_86 but get well soon boys. https://t.co/nTV8a2hI8r
@TihoBrkan Beautiful projects @TihoBrkan Natural Roofing Slate is my specialty. Reach out to me if I can ever be of help. Be great to work with you! @NewEnglandSlate
The irony on calling the report “borderline fraud” with a post like this. At least his disclaimer explains the bias. https://t.co/smMG1Uo3Iw
@businessinsider Great 3 minute article. Very enlightening. You don’t suppose greed for the $60K blood kicks in and more than 30% of their blood is extracted?? Problem not going to get better quickly.
@DanielDaigle7 Awesome view man!! 🍻
Bingo!
@mattdracing @woodbrothers21 should be the new leader.
Very well said. Where were you 20 years ago?? https://t.co/fHb1rA5sE6
@loribanks @woodbrothers21 @Leonard_Wood Used to email Kim now and then, but been a little while now. Life’s just hectic. Send her some Vermont Maple syrup (for the team) when my wife’s son has a good year (21 jugs lol). Maybe you’ve had some! Anyway, thanks for passing the Birthday wishes. Super cool gent.
@loribanks @woodbrothers21 @Leonard_Wood Leonard reminds me of my dad. We won hot passes for that race from the #23 team (Richardson, Jr.) We had been to numerous races up here in the northeast but never had passes. Was really special. My dad had cancer and couldn’t be in the sun much but he managed.
@woodbrothers21 Happy Birthday @Leonard_Wood Happy memory from 2012 at Daytona. https://t.co/LGzrfEpXv5
Had to take a 2 min break from work to try it. Well worth every second. 💪🍻 https://t.co/WUMUlLjeor
I may be biased, but @NASCAR shoulda thrown the caution flag with 20 laps (or so) to go. Instead of getting the lucky dog pass, @mattdracing @woodbrothers21 picks up DEBRIS while running 7th. Certainly could have changed the outcome of the race. Regardless, great run.
@allegramiles @TheVoiceABSCBN You’re very welcome and thanks for sharing your voice and cheer. Believe in yourself and always do things for the right reasons. Tune out the naysayers, they’re not worth your time. Focus on your goals. Always prepare yourself - when opportunities arise, you’ll be ready.
1985 vintage tho!  👀😲💵🍷 https://t.co/NtQMZX8ycg
Two favorite parts of @NFL this year:  1.) @carrieunderwood kicking off @SNFonNBC  2.) Shane DeFalco at QB #thereplacements #KeanuReeves
@carrieunderwood 8 years already?!?!  Wow. Your opening act is just as good as the game itself. Looking forward to seeing this years version tonight! 🎤🎶👀
@woodbrothers21 looked like the guys got a handle on the car in the last segment. Seemed to keep his gap with the leaders at the end. Got a lot of points to make up next week, but progress is progress. @BMSupdates baby!!🏁
I know it’s been over for a while, but just binged and got caught up on @TheVoiceABSCBN tonight. So many great talents, but shocked that @allegramiles wasn’t the winner. Most incredible/unique voice. 🎤 🎶 🎶 Stay humble, you’ll go far.

@TihoBrkan Wisdom beyond your years. Cheers to you and thank you for sharing. 🍻
@SeanEFootball @JClarkNBCS @72TraThomas @Ike58Reese @BleedingGreen @PHLEaglesNation @NBCSPhilly @JawsCEOQB @NBCPhiladelphia @ZERTZ_86 @Eagles Well said. Feeling is mutual by the team I’m sure. Solid on and off the field.  Hate to say it, but NFL teams are a business. Hope it can be worked out, one of the best and don’t want to play against him!
@BrianDawkins Preach Dawg. You are worth it too!
Cute but so true. https://t.co/ulolGuOkw7
@TihoBrkan @TihoBrkan Bought a run down home across the street from our res. at a tax sale in rural Vermont for $8K. Place was a dump! Gutted it and put a lot of sweat/$$ into it. Turned it into a rental (now an air B&amp;B). Cleaned up the neighborhood &amp; turned it into a great income source
Being in the top 12 in standings is a huge accomplishment. Not much of an advantage for ⁦@woodbrothers21⁩ and ⁦@mattdracing⁩ - 5 weeks in a row and random starting draws of 10-12, including tonight’s race. ⁦@KevinHarvick⁩ thought he was getting tough draws...🤕 https://t.co/AbJsw1kyOE
@thestinkmarket @OMillionaires Can I preorder one with a $10 deposit?
@EvanKirstel I’m gonna have to take your word on it. But very cool.
@SkipFlores Nice!  Congrats man.
@woodbrothers21 @mattdracing Jon, agreed 100% on blame and points.  That last lap incident was just a racing deal.  Coulda been given more room, coulda not pressed for the pass.  I like the aggressiveness.  Car/team was awesome, one of the most solid runs I can remember at Indy.  Up front all day - Kudos!
@biggercapital You must mean CROX...
@woodbrothers21 Yup, if I gotta wear a mask, these are it!

Been doing some work on my garage and bought a box of masks for putting in the insulation. Tried to return them to ⁦@HomeDepot⁩ couple months ago, but wouldn’t take them back. Worked out best. Donated them to my favorite nurse ⁦⁦@taylorsargent90⁩ #nursesareheroes https://t.co/LftIAJ8zYQ
