After thousands of years of living with rain, worms,... they really just un-evolving dummies
@KaylaSchueller Awe thank you Kayla!! 💛🖤
If you’re on a bridge of your own please talk to someone, myself, a doctor, a friend, or the Suicide Lifeline - 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/1yCGLzR2iO
Biggest irritant of being a republican in 2021. Trump supports were boasting about Trump getting a vaccine before the end of 2020. And now those same conservatives are sharing fears and nonsense about the covid vaccines and stating they don’t want it or are scared of it, like wtf
4 seconds and Alabama does that.?!!!!!!
My music determines if imma go 25 or 125
Wearing a shirt with your name stitched on it in a bar isn’t my best move.😅
Nothing says your a dad more than your dog crying in pain, making you cry in pain for him, then running to the vet ER and crying hoping everything is okay with him
I was today years old when I realized there are more planes in the ocean than boats in the sky. 🤯

When you wake up to ur power being out. And it apparently is gonna be out for hours..
Me listening to Loud Luxury’s ‘Sex Like Me’ Zack “is this called chicken sesame”
Abigail is the girl that country songs are written about🥺❤️ @BachelorABC
Twitter and Facebook need to pick if they’re publishers or public forums!! Like they reap all the rewards of claiming to be public forums with section 230 of the CDA. But then they can freely sensor as if they’re a publisher?! They can’t have it both ways in my opinion
As a conservative, I don’t personally know any conservatives who are okay with what’s happening at the capital right now. If Biden won, Biden won. Quit acting like f^*€ing two year olds throwing a fit. Also we better be charging everyone to the fullest extent of the law. Imo
So Nancy Pelosi proposed the 117th congress rules two days ago. After reviewing it, she wants to de gender all of congress. For example; grandmother -&gt; grandparent, son or daughter -&gt; child, and step-father -&gt; stepparent.. to list a few. Yet her own official Twitter.. https://t.co/ebpYCiaBtE
One of the restaurants my grandpa built, the Country Junction, just closed permanently because of covid after being open for 30 years... sad
Coralville is nothing without Iowa city, soooo wtf do they have the chic fil a?!

@Estevan_Corn21 Is this off an iPad or curser! It’s really good, I’m just curious?!
@sammyjeanmontag Remember Toby and I once ur famous plz and Thnk u
Women will hate a man strictly because of their name
So I am 100,000% not an anti-vaccine guy at all, like legit, not at all. I trust the medical scientists who make vaccines and medicines for a living. But like I just had the freaky nightmare, like what if all the frontline workers who received it first suddenly died from it?

If y’all could keep my Grandpa in your thoughts that’d be huge. Was just informed he’s been put in hospice as his health has quickly deteriorated. He’s my grandpa on my dads side, and the last blood “father” figure I have as I’ve already lost my moms father and my actual Father..
Hands down, I think the most terrifying nightmare when you’ve lost a parent is the fear of unexpectedly loosing your other..
@sammyjeanmontag Can confirm, it’s her, she’s friends
I ammmmmm getttinnn old, my friends out here getting engaged!!!
We punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt, we punt, they punt..
We didn’t go on that 4th n 1 why Kirk?!
At the end of the day,  it’s night.

If my future wife won’t let me invest in 1,000s of dollars in Christmas lights I’m selling her car
Haven’t enjoyed life since grade school kickball tbh
Tobys skills are evolving, he can now reliably lock and unlock the truck as well as roll down the passenger window at will.... while I’m on the hwy
Yo IC is snowing snowing
If only venting to a therapist was as easy as it is in Among Us
So today Toby was eating supper and all of the sudden he stopped and started crying. And boom I’m on the ground listening to see if he was breathing or if he was hurt somehow. Also checked to see if he was choking while patting his back. Zack and I determined he bit his tongue.
Watching movies alone is not a move
Hey Iowa. How about we, idk, maybe like stop Penns quarterback from walking right thru our defense every other play.

It Toby wants to play with Nala while I’m tryna cuddle, we compromise and cuddle.
It’s always “accept cookies?” and never “here are your cookies”

Awhile ago a nurse from the children’s hospital wrote Cambus saying how one of her kiddo patients loved to see the busses out the window. After posting an idea to our Facebook group it became a reality, now all the kiddos up there can wave even when the Hawks aren’t on the field. https://t.co/31MrUR8Hbm
Yeah thank you tinder, you’re right she is popular but for some reason I doubt my super like will help a 150,000/10 pick me
Update got everything back that was stolen outta my truck. Update wanna kms
Sooooooo woke up andddddddd some fuckn low life broke into my truck
While I’m happy with the direction the election is going. We can’t ignore that this isn’t officially over till all the ballots are counted that were submitted by the deadlines today.
Just my thoughts, I always respect others opinions and love debating and hearing their sides of the argument. I don’t see how unfollowing people based on their opinions is an effective way to come together to talk and meet in the middle somewhere? Idk just my opinion at least
At the end of this election, I hope everyone remembers we are all Americans! We are all passionate about our own party and that’s important to remember. Some of us will rejoice tonight and some of us will be saddened. But that’s no reason to attack anyone personally in my opinion
Election Day shopping 😅🙃 https://t.co/VTMgH9YnHG
@LegitLarkin The word “compete” screws this all up. Equal footing so everyone can compete?! Soooo capitalism?!
Oops Ope well
Fetch is so unfair for Toby. Even when he gets the frisbee first, Nala just comes and finesses it from him. To be fair Toby is 20lbs and the bear is 65lbs https://t.co/ocK8AA1h2T
Hey everyone vote already plz.... I just wanna watch puppy videos without relearning that her father was a crop duster.

@Politics_Polls @TheEconomist This won’t age well, I’m callin it!
I really wish someone could crack my back rn, just like lightly rolling over me with a steam roller
Okay Trump. Not an earth hippie but you are soooo WRONG about your windmill info! They are intermittent and there are many flaws, but most are made in America!! (far to large to cost effectively be imported) Plus, Trump, your skyscrapers kill more birds than a damn windmill!
@LegitLarkin “Unify ‘OUR’ student body” 🤦🏼‍♂️
Honestly who lets me keep my phone when I’m drunk.... ... .. .
So I’m at the vet hospital with Toby... and this girl brought her golden retriever into the locked entry way (Covid) and I didn’t realize why.. then she came out crying w/o her baby. then the vets carefully carried her outta the room in a blanket. I’m crying and praying for her..
*Zack on Omegle* Zack- “Damn the sun is out in the background, where are you from?” Random- ”The Southern Hemisphere” *Zack stares at me* Zack- ”Where’s that?” 😳😂
Okay so I now wanna try the pinkety drinkidy
