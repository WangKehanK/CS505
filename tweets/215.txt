I cannot put into words how excited I am to be done with school so I can finally go to bed at a reasonable time  I literally can’t recall the last time I went to bed before 2am, exhausted is an understatement

Now that’s true love right there @ChipotleTweets 🥺❤️ https://t.co/qCBG3XFL0E
I have no idea why tf tinder still shows me women. It’s not like I forgot to pay my gay subscription or something, the gay isn’t going away hun.

I have to stay off social media because I haven’t watched the finale of Wandavision but I keep wanting to procrastinate on a paper I have to write so that makes me wanna go on social media and now I’m conflicted. Help.
