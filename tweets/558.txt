@luminouslutrine This is actually true, most pizza rolls are way too hot to eat even after being left to sit, and are way harder to prepare in general, they‚Äôre usually mushy and they mix all the flavors together into a weird pizza smoothie, I stand with you
@Frostburnt No that‚Äôs me
@PinkHairedCat gifs are definitely accurate determinants of personality

@cronchyshark that makes sense!!! so you can go to one for a certain type of content. Will you be theming tweets around their personality traits?
@cronchyshark Will you still have a main for all the spicy hot takes and funny memes?
