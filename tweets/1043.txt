Brad Davidson is the softest and most overrated player in the big ten😂 #WISvsPUR

Zero consistency by these refs. Only “letting them play” when MSU is defending lol #MSUvsPUR
@HabitualBoiler “let em play” only when MSU is defending lol
@Complex @noahbeck @McDonalds 😐
@ComplexSneakers @thehapablonde all this to drop 7 points, a couple rebounds, and a block

@klevy1414 @SOLELINKS wtf
@SOLELINKS BRUH SO WHAT IF OUR EMAIL ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS IS SO STUPID
@SportsCenter I think I speak for all Chiefs fans when I say we don’t want Mahomes, he is just a liability. I think it would be best to trade him to the Bears in exchange for a couple first rounders and a solid defensive player, he is holding us back and we need defense as well.
@ChicagoBears @LyricaLemonade @_ColeBennett_ @cshimala rock solid like me if we get Watson
@EASPORTSCollege NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS????? 😭😭😭😭
@Complex Drake is the living embodiment of “Where my hug at?”
