you expect me to fight in a civil war against the trumpets when i‚Äôm too small to even take a full dose of nighttime cold medicine?

this is gone far past ‚Äúfirst amendment rights‚Äù
‚Äúthey were promised by the president that this would do something to change the election‚Äù

in school we really had to have a parent note just to have cough drops
i live in wv. i have eaten turkey heart and some sketchy deer meat on multiple occasions that was prepared by a weird relative. i am not afraid of the covid vaccine.
the mental and physical pain are really going hand in hand these days

my house decided to ring in the new year by busting our water main and partially flooding our basement causing us to not have any water until someone can hopefully fix it tomorrow

i hate when people take and post photos of them pretending to be asleep. like we know you did not post this in your sleep and no one took that photo of you

@theone_desired I work at bath and body and there are far too many people in the store at one time when we‚Äôre busy and too many people still don‚Äôt wear a mask or don‚Äôt wear it correctly
inhaling an orange before going to my job at the mall hoping the vitamin c and my two masks will protect me from the people that still think they don‚Äôt need to wear a mask
@LaurelMuhly @sweetcaro018 @drew_harbert not to mention it is still illegal and this event was rejected by the health department multiple times before it even occurred. the fact that some people think homecoming is more important than a pandemic is disgusting.
wearing 2 masks to work bc people still think that they don‚Äôt need to wear a mask. too broke to quit but not too broke to die ‚úåüèº
i‚Äôm so tired of asking people ‚Äúdid you find everything okay?‚Äù

having a chronic illness while also being a broke college student is physically causing yourself pain to work an 8 hour shift 4-5 days a week at your local small town mall
living in wv is dropping entire syllables off of your words and your family still completely understanding what you‚Äôre saying
