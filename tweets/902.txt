The first 7 seconds is how I felt during my PRK surgery. Granted mine was with what looked like an electric toothbrush, but the Valium the doctor gave me made it feel like this. https://t.co/JR1XtveBte
My eye surgery causes me to take so many spontaneous naps. I’ll just be watching Netflix (well, mostly listening)....then BAM! I’m asleep for an hour without even realizing it.
@low_key_abi I will give him this information. Much appreciated☺️
My dad forgot that last week was the season finale of Wanda Vision.....I had to break the news to him when he came into the living room all excited for the new episode. We. Need. More. Episodes.
@JoeBiden I will begin my first year of teaching next year, so I will use the money for supplies and decorations for my new classroom!
I’m just saying this because I get asked about it so much.....Tom probably can’t come to Texas this summer because EUROPE IS STILL BANNED BC OF COVID. So, friendly reminder that this virus is still very much affecting my life☺️😷
All I want is a @CrumblCookies Strawberry pop tart cookie, but there is no way I can get to Tyler with this Texas weather🥺🥺🥺🥺
I am so proud of you, DJ😭❤️ @dj_johnsonmusic https://t.co/oCawsByDx1
@low_key_abi @kennzumm @sami20taylor @canderson1399 @LaurenOliviaRob Kennedy usually takes mine😂
Kinda rude that my friends are at college together without me. Like kinda thought y’all would graduate or drop out when I finished. Rude.
@allie_n2 I had an English teacher say that we can’t say “bless you” because we aren’t priests....and he was serious.
@kelseyschwartzz I am now Ms. Rogers to a lot of 8/9 year olds and it makes me feel OLD

Side note: popped blood vessels are from the suction tool used for LASIK (as terrifying as it sounds). The machine deciding to like...not work....so they have to suction my eyes a few times when trying to get it to work properly. I wasn’t jumped or anything👌🏼
Yesterday I was SUPPOSED to get LASIK but complications caused us to have to reschedule (hence all the popped blood vessels).......Today was my first day with the 3rd graders I am a long term sub for....with a bloody looking eye.....Hopefully didn’t scare them too much🤣 https://t.co/f1AWVUflu5
Me: *prays to God asking him whether Tom and I should live in America or Germany”  God: *sets America on fire.*
@radskater382 @SammyBoy578 And the swim between the docks!🤢🤮
At least having to wear a mask at the airport means that people may not notice that I am sobbing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Perks of having an online college graduation: my mom sending me pictures of my cat watching my graduation💙 https://t.co/ZEDv6JNBVK
@kelseyschwartzz I voted, but wherever you will end up with less debt!! Trust me on that!
@low_key_abi @LaurenOliviaRob 10/10 would NOT recommend graduating
Starbucks forgot to put the Cinnamon Dolce syrup in my double shot this morning and when I told you I nearly cried......
Get you a man knows how to spoil you https://t.co/HA2tnRVjV5
I get to see my boyfriend for the first time in a YEAR (nearly 365 DAYS) thanks to COVID this December, so if you see me listening to Christmas music in October mind your own business 🎅🏼✌🏼
@radskater382 I’ll forgive you, but not Bruno
@radskater382 Just when I thought that Tom and I were the cutest couple......I see this.
@low_key_abi @em_kjellin This is me except I don’t have any sanity left.
@low_key_abi A really cute minion tho
@Kaitlyngibson_ @allie_n2 Sweet Kaitlyn🥺 The balance between school, friends, and work is so hard, but you have to put your needs first! One of the hardest adjustments that I had! You got this!💕
@MC_SpeedLibrary 32 signs
@low_key_abi That is so impressive🤯
@low_key_abi @MC_SpeedLibrary @MissCollege I NEED access to coffee where I can use my points😭
@phoenix__bp Then you get to college and use primarily APA........
@cpsue76 2!!
My teenage coworkers said that I am a perfect example of an adult. Y’all. I have no idea what I am doing. Is this being an adult?
I haven’t seen my boyfriend since January and we won’t be allowed to until America’s numbers go down. Sooooooo can y’all please wear a mask and social distance? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
@phoenix__bp There are no set in stone plans as of yet😊

@Trevornoah @Ratrogers is a 2nd grade teacher who has been working her BOOTY off during this quarantine! Daily read alouds✅ Virtual Field Trip Fridays✅ Sending out class friendship bracelets✅ Doing it all on a laptop that is slowly dying✅  You won’t regret it!
@cpsue76 I’m so sorry, sweet Carlee:( I’m a phone call away if you need someone to talk to❤️
(Being able to see each other involved travel bans being lifted btw)
Can people please stay at home so that this can go away and I can see my boyfriend this summer? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
