Some people really don't understand  how to act in a pandemic and it's so aggravating, like we've been at this for a YEAR

This has NOTHING to do with the blm protests, so stop trying to make yourselves feel better about how shitty YOUR president and YOUR fellow followers are.

No more common decency for Trump supporters. After this, you don't deserve any ounce of my respect.
A pipe bomb found at the RNC??? You're telling me this isn't terrorist behavior???
This is not freedom of speech. This is not democracy. This is intimidation. This is hard-headed childish behavior. These are people who cannot accept the outcomes of a democratic system. And honestly, it's pathetic.
Three months ago we all understood that traveling was a bad idea, and now three months later, NOTHING has changed but everyone thinks its okay to travel across the country?????

SO hard to sit through class everyday acting like this shit matters when we have a homophobic, racist, xenophobic, ableist, classist, sexist white man speaking for our country. I've never felt more anxious about an election year.
