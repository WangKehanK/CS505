@PuccaNoodles Due to unfortunate circumstances, Flint had the aid of a trusted demon ally, to help turn him into a demi-human, essentially making him immortal.ðŸ˜ˆ  Flint is a mysterious figure, who often hides in the shadows. No one really knows of his true intentions~
@PuccaNoodles (The drawing here's old, apologies- :'DD) This here's Flint! Flint Ethan Clarke! A man from London, born around the 1800's. He looks like as if he were in his mid-twenties, but he's faaar older than what you see. (1/2) https://t.co/ZsFXhzdDpp
@Thuminnoo Racist trolls really be out here.ðŸ˜’ The shit with these mf's is just so fucking sad and pathetic, I want to SCREAM. If they keep making videos like that I'm positive it won't be long until their channel's finally taken down.
