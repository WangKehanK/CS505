I hate when people who know nothing about technology try to lecture me about how much things are worth. I went to a garage sale and I asked them how much for an iPhone charger.   They said ‚Äú$20 because it costs $60 at the Apple store‚Äù üòê
I honestly can‚Äôt wait until AirTags come out because I lose my wallet way too often
I think people should stop saying ‚Äúyou need to start loving yourself‚Äù as if it is easy to do so
I absolutely hate when people go out of their way to make you feel worse
