Iowaâ€™s running into the classic conundrum of trying to win a tournament game when 60% of their starting 5 doesnâ€™t score a point. Itâ€™s a bold strategy, I will admit. But with high risk comes high reward

Pretending the Mizzou loss didnâ€™t happen for my own happiness
I canâ€™t figure out why people say we arenâ€™t still in the Drake era
The greatest sin in the history of my life is that The Heist won best album over good mid m.A.A.d city
Giving Patonâ€™s first offseason a solid B+. Signed who we needed to, cut excess fat, just need ILB and QB help. https://t.co/jgoiZcQz1t
I really regret giving Bieber grief regarding his music in the early 2010s. He hasnâ€™t missed since Purpose
The only thing I take from these older tournament games is that Gus Johnson needs to be back announcing games asap https://t.co/5gK7OqTqEP

Mahomes family is handling last nights L fairly well imo
Brady going through Brees, Rodgers, and Mahomes is arguably the greatest playoff performance ever in any sport
That O Line barely gave mahomes a chance
Legitimate ass kicking. That Mahomes line is borderline embarrassing
Iâ€™m not gonna hit my Scotty Miller O1.5 receptions prop bet and thatâ€™s going to really really upset me

Tony Romo once again has become insufferable
The CBS pregame show is garbage
I donâ€™t understand the benefit of having officials on the court
That Britt Reid story is heartbreaking man
My biggest sporting pet peeve is the absence of the salary cap in the MLB

Stafford is in no way the missing piece for the Rams with the amount of turnover they have on a regular basis, both player and staff
This is objectively a booty trade @RamsNFL  @Lions

Great teams cover. Atta baby @Browns
Lotta lotta questions over the decision to run mahomes on a speed option ðŸ¤”
Didnâ€™t look like Mahomes hit his head? Very odd
Thatâ€™s what ya get for wearing two gloves as a kicker
Targeting is a stupid rule bc it exists in college but not the NFL.  Fumbling through the ends zone is a stupid rule bc it makes absolutely no sense how itâ€™s a change of possession.
Romoâ€™s fawning over mahomes is never not annoying
Lindsey Graham could have had multiple Senate colleagues killed and heâ€™s still be out here saying nobody should face consequences for it https://t.co/7Ezu1u9KVW
