@JoshCrego Like I know posting it is childish but like I’ve left you alone and you’ve left me alone, Like we didn’t work out so be it, There’s no need to constantly try and make yourself a part of someone’s life that’s trying to forget all about you.
@JoshCrego Yes dude, It’s dumb asf, Like I’m doing better for myself.
@JoshCrego My last ex, Like it’s been 2 years please stop talking about me.
