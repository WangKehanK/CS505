@venom0804 @IAmLindsayJones @Twitch @TwitchSupport bruh he has a job, he says so. they dont want him to have easy acsess to young fans who he can abuse, like he jas been doing for years.
@AliveAgain888 @FrecklesNFrce trials take time, and the fans on twitter arent going to be the first to know, and also you can still stream with a criminal record im pretty sure. it will likely be years till a trial happens and if people push charges which they dont always do.

i think im gonna take a break from twitter for like, a long time, hmu on discord
i feel bad and like im giving up but i just cant keep looking at news, at the number of people dying, at the rest of the world recovering while people who didnt believe in the sickness die off, its disgraceful amd saddening
you know i really thought this would be it, the thing that could push the democrats left, the thing that republicans would say went too far, but it just wasnt, america is just a country of poison and i cant stand it, truth seems to mean nothing anymore
sometimes you just look at the news and the state of the country and you just cry
only good thing about today is ill know a reasom why i hear fireworks all night
