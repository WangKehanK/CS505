@WyattPike just saw you singing on american idol and immediately fell in love with you
it’s so cringy when a man compliments me, but when a woman does it, my heart goes 💖💘💕✨🪐💓💝💕💗✨
and i really sat here and watched the whole thing https://t.co/3p0AI6UwKp
@stackiejokes love you too 🥺💖
@stackiejokes happy birthday loml!! have the best day ever!! 💖🥳
why do men think making fun of women for being on their periods is like... top tier comedy? https://t.co/IasXaTkkM7
holidays are no fun when your siblings are grown up lol
11 hours later after this tweet and i still have cold chills while sweating to death. and now my stomach really hurts. wtf :/
i’m sitting in a tiny waiting room with three men, and a woman just walked in and i am so relieved lol
this second vaccine is definitely more intense then the first one. with the first one, all i had was a sore arm. but this second one, i’ve been waking up every couple hours because i have such intense chills and dizziness. this is... fun.
i’m here trying to show my grandma few of the songs i want played at my wedding if i ever have one and she’s shitting on every single one of them like wtf??? lmao
i’m fully vaccinated!!!!!! https://t.co/SgeHSWJkjo
i have THE BEST name for when i have a son and i am never telling anybody so no one can take it
“There is an exception if the mother’s life is in danger, but not in the case of rape or incest.”   read that as many times as you need to to understand how absolutely fucked this is. if abortions were banned, i promise you, they. would. not. stop. fuckin assholes. https://t.co/33ZZuF6Hop
i get my second dose of the vaccine tomorrow 😳
all the women that walked by and just stared at her did not pass the vibe check... should have immediately ran up to her and covered her. https://t.co/yK66cypjaG
i meant affect***
@dougducey fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck your fuck your fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you
yet the mask mandate is being revoked??? that’s 23 deaths too many, and along with all the family members their deaths will effect? are you guys fucking stupid? https://t.co/I4CI5XNgX1
i cannot watch this episode. no matter how much i try to, i just can’t lol https://t.co/7rTEQq5hji
i actually had to think for a second https://t.co/SC4y6IBE9N
@sedonaprince_ i would like your hand in marriage
literally same, i’m not complaining though 😳 https://t.co/KjHFVb0ifY
@Devan_rose00 girl i have been traumatized since i was like four after watching that scene 😩
the saddest movie scene ever is the one in never ending story and if you’ve seen that movie, you know what scene i’m talking about :(

https://t.co/0s76bidSCO
@imcalledadri dude i so would 😩😩
there’s nothing i want more right now than some texas roadhouse rolls
this is kind of a shitty thing to say, considering this pandemic has actually cost many people their jobs. $1400 can feed someone’s kid, help out with rent, and buy the necessities to live. so if you don’t want yours, i’m sure someone else would take it in a heartbeat :) https://t.co/Iu12iIWdaO
21 year old are not kids what the fuck https://t.co/mLIbzMP8vQ
the first time i got whistled at and catcalled was when i was 14 walking by myself through an outlet mall trying to find my mom and i don’t think i’ll ever forget it lol
how do i get a video tattooed on me? https://t.co/LSWTMvaSkU
had to cancel my card because someone was using it and can’t buy anything until i get my new one in 7-14 business days, probably a blessing in disguise
living with a man is possibly the worst thing ever, do not recommend
starbucks barista: hi what can i get started for you today?   me: can i have a very berry hibiscus refresher? &amp; am i able to get strawberries in that? if not, it’s totally okay &amp; i do not want to inconvince you whatsoever or make you work harder than you should light of my life.
ummmm netflix is taking the perks of being a wallflower off on march 31st???? wtf?? no??
100% on my midterm was the best news i’ve been given today
i just want to feel the adrenaline rush i had in third grade while doing the multiplication tests
sorry but i literally gagged https://t.co/DilcIFcMjT
literally me watching my mom make her fucking boyfriend a plate while he stands right behind her watching https://t.co/v6ZA4fVoSk
you really ruin my fucking mood
i hate that the lovely bones is my comfort movie because it is such a good movie but it makes me furious
@LivSquire i got my pepper spray at walmart! thank god i’ve never had to use it. i’ve been wanting to get one on those cat defense claws, so expensive though 😩
if you’re a crime documentary junkie like moi, watch “see no evil” on discovery+. all the episodes have security footage of people’s last moments. it’s so good and scary.
right? i was so nervous to even put my groceries in the car. that’s why i stared at my car far back for like 30 seconds. i always keep my car key in between my fingers and my finger on my pepper spray. i literally pray i’m never in a situation where i never have to use them. https://t.co/x7RODiQ8YV
@joey_celis i can’t even tell you how many fucking hair ties i’ve broken trying to put my hair up. breaking so many in a row is just heartbreaking and makes me not even want my hair up anymore lmao
omg there was a panini maker at target for $10 so i did the reasonable thing and bought it :)
then i got out of walmart &amp; saw the same car sitting in the same spot but didn’t see anyone in it. i stared all around my car about 15 feet away, i looked underneath, walked around to the windshield, looked at my windows, literally inspected everything before i got in.
i got out of my car at walmart today and saw a man literally looking back at me through his rear car window. we stared at each other for about 15 seconds before i yell “WHAT?” to him. he looked away at that point.
@jasminedang_ it was really quick and easy. there is a pinch like every other shot and your arm gets extremely sore after. i think the side effects depend on the person. my grandma, my mom, and i all got it and we had no side effects except a sore arm. it’s a really easy process!
12 hours after my shot, now a very VERY sore arm. no other side effects. it was very difficult to lift my arm up to wash my hair in the shower.
3 hours after the covid shot, the only side effect is my arm is very sore lol
i got myself getting the vaccine on video hehe
i get my covid shot today!!
here’s the full picture. so cute 🥺 https://t.co/DZL5LSWzhl
it took me a good few minutes to figure out “two socks” is the name of the mom horse lmfaosjdjdj https://t.co/rQ4yiPEADO
seth rogen doing pottery.   that’s it. that’s the tweet.

one thing i’m looking forward to when i have kids is getting breakfast in bed, even if the food isn’t cooked right. that’s the cutest shit ever🥺

i was supposed to have this phone interview at 12 and now it’s 1. i called and the guy said when he’s finished helping a customer he’ll call me back. that was at 12:15. i literally don’t know what to do rn lmfao
@eastfrancis omg same, i’ve been singing it all day
i think phone interviews stress me out more than in-person interviews
