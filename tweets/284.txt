now Denton is under a boil water notice, we do not have a stove in our dorm jail cell. I had to get vending machine bottled water, walk up 18 flights of stairs.....for the third time today... 54 flights of stairs!!! what else could go wrong
we had to evacuate the dorm we were sent to after having to evacuate our apartments because there was a fire!! then had to walk up 18 flights of stairs!! what else could go wrong🥺🥴😭 I just want to go home
so we were evacuated from our apartment, was told to bring the essentials to move into a random cold dorm room in the snow 🥴🥺 I would very much like to go home now
no power and snow day....wish I was at home :(
