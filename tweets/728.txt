All you lil boys out at the beach on spring break and I’m out here working and making money. We not the same.😅
If today was my last day I’d have no regrets. Could you say the same?💯
The problem with life is it’s only understood backwards, but can only be lived forwards.

@AlanaCulwell You do that.
@AlanaCulwell Nah just change in general. Like an “I’m sorry” means nothing if whatever you’re sorry for keeps happening.
I don’t need apology’s, I need change.
@AlanaCulwell Mhm

I’m exhausted... not so much physically, but mentally. There are too many thoughts and emotions going through my head at the moment. I’ve set a list of goals ahead of me, and I find it harder and harder to reach them each day, but I’ve always been taught nothing is unreachable...
I feel like I’m stuck in this continuous loop that starts at happy and never ends well🥱
@AlanaCulwell But I Love You😘
I’ll never be the type to entertain others.

I refuse to cut myself short. I know what I deserve.
Moving 100 miles per hour, yet I’m at a stand still.😓
@AlanaCulwell Damn we need to talk if this is how you feel.
@AlanaCulwell I Love You Most🥰
My Love for you grows stronger and stronger every day. Thank you for being the amazing person you are to me. I Love You Alana Lee.!💞 https://t.co/zRweujMO5L
