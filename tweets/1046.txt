You ever just be chilling then realize your the reason all your relationships fuck up?.... because same
The hate I have for having to work out my arms at the gym is unbelievable😂
Imma say this now, I say Trump will either blow up our own country or he’s gonna fake his death/kill him self in the next month!
Can we talk about how George O’Malley on Greys Anatomy again?! Because I’m not crying or anything🥴
It’s 34 above here in Florida and I am absolutely fucking freezing....
I’m pretty sure I have been ghosted more on bumble BFF than by any guy
@Kdocster98 FIGHT THAT BITCH!!
Depression is hitting a little hard tonight
Being fat shamed after losing 109 pounds is wack!
Closest hockey rink to me is 3 hours away and I don’t know how I feel about it🥴😩
Something that concerns me about my self is that I think I could easily eat my body weight in popcorn...
I’m missing all the fun trouble I got into Alaska😂
Hit my lowest weight yet of 195!!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Sitting in Dunkin’ Donuts drive through and this man behind me starts asking me about my Alaska licenses plate😂
It honestly hurts sometimes how much younger me wouldn’t like who I am...
Found a tick on me and now I’m fearing for my life🙃

People were right once you get out on your own you really do call/text your mom 2+ times a day. Just FT my mom to show her how I fit into a size medium😂😂
@messinerrr @carlymarie51 @angel_fabiaan What part of Florida?! That’s where I moved to!!
I hate how scared I get when I am happy like I just want to sabotage it all🙃
