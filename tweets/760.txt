@btvjim @Konstructible @jaycatvt extended family member works there, hoping to get an insider view at some point!
@jaycatvt That‚Äôs the one!
That funky copter plane thing is flying around today if you wanna peep it. Tailed by a tradish copter. https://t.co/rNnStexUs4
What do they do with all the bricks? https://t.co/pcVJ2Wd0lB
Under his eye. https://t.co/uGPLbkhoWA
Founders Hall at SMC is about to come down, wish I could get my hands in a pile of the bricks for landscaping.   That corner is gonna be weird without it.
‚ÄúHere's a confession: I've mostly enjoyed the isolation.‚Äù   Yep, same. https://t.co/BsCKLdhpM5
@MattCrawford This could be the most Vermont tweet of all time.
@jessamyn @QuantumLeapCap LB taught me to read, would love to see him host Jeopardy! https://t.co/fw64zTYyBG
You know what to do. üíâ #OurShotVT https://t.co/xg8ziHeKpk
Very much enjoyed the #HemingwayPBS series. Ken Burns with another winner.
@jessamyn I love this, thank you!
Aaron Rodgers voice is pretty soothing. Dig it. #Jeopardy
The chocolates are very good, but shockingly expensive. Wonder who their new neighbors will be when Tiny Thai moves out this weekend. #winooski https://t.co/XF0B5thrNV
@kevinbcarter Its been some Spring. We really didn't even have winter in March. I'm not sure how to handle it all, I'm sure it will probably snow in June now lol.
Bummer.  Please be advised that the Rage Against the Machine performance originally scheduled to take place at Madison Square Garden on Thursday, August 13, 2020 that was postponed to Monday, August 9, 2021 has now been rescheduled to Thursday, August 11, 2022.
@healthvermont Put together this post of tips for people trying to get signed up sooner! #OurShotVT https://t.co/KLCn9jRJeh
Hey look, one of my shows finally has a new date! https://t.co/fRQTijf0xG
@MattCrawford @DaveSilberman Good call!
@Kevin_Lumpkin @DaveSilberman @MattCrawford added to post, thanks!
@MattCrawford @DaveSilberman updated, thank you!
Hey @DaveSilberman @MattCrawford or anyone else, what else should I add to this post for helping peeps get signed up? #OurShotVT https://t.co/KLCn9jRJeh
Essex and Williston and of course Bennington are still open at 8:30am
@vtrockdork @MattCrawford CVS is for sure the better app and functionality. Walgreens is clunky AF.
Passport and backpack. https://t.co/2OKweVpAX3
@beerlington Yessssss! https://t.co/wjwqrTJn2N
I‚Äôve been sharing on other socials as well and helped some folks. I don‚Äôt see or interact with people IRL yet but eventually I may consider it again. It takes a village! https://t.co/oth2wYatxo
The juxtaposition of the rioting and a father out with his kid riding her bike amongst it all is wild. What a fucked up world. https://t.co/SZx4eap0hy
JOY!! https://t.co/0ToKUJ2oRg
@NatronVT No doubt, that itinerary you booked still makes me giggle.
Lots of appointments on CVS this morning! #OurShotVT #btv area https://t.co/UgzloskPDv
@AlexSVenet @beerlington Somehow they seem to be louder now, like they turned on the ‚Äúhey fuck y‚Äôall‚Äù switch.   Frustrating.
@beerlington It‚Äôs SUCKKKKKKKKKS
This is great advice, remember if you are trying to upgrade your state appointment you can click reschedule without losing your current spot before confirming a new one. #OurShotVT https://t.co/07wtA9z5Z9
Same. https://t.co/liqru3QFRv
I have to move.
and... https://t.co/kQhTHJQX4s
Currently appointments open on CVS as of right meow in #BTV. #OurShotVT https://t.co/wpigIxUfkE
@DustinTannerVT It‚Äôs forever now, or you can apply to be criminally rehabilitated after 5 years which I‚Äôm sorta working on but with the border closed I haven‚Äôt put much effort into it.
@DustinTannerVT I‚Äôm still not allowed in Canada sadly, someday I hope to be again.
@jess_aloe @AlexSVenet For sure, I‚Äôve paid to park there for a week so this would easily cover that cost. I typically connect in JFK because JetBlue but Boston often has/had affordable Norwegian and similar budget flights to Europe.
@DustinTannerVT I could see myself doing a down and back for dinner or a game but it would be rare, plus you can take a plane to a much greater city called New York for the same price!
@jess_aloe Yeah I can do that drive in my sleep, and...probably have. I like the drive, can't imagine a flight would be cheap enough to make it worthwhile, but who knows!
@danruss https://t.co/WJSM5tFlII
Interesting, this must be only about a 30 minute flight yeah? NYC is/was often only 45 minutes. https://t.co/7F6zPL9zkZ
I‚Äôm ready to party. Thanks @taylordobbs üçÅ #MadeInVT https://t.co/ytiSC4Fl0n
@McConvilleVT Ah nice, well you should be able to tell when you login to your portal look for the 1 or the 2. Also, you can click "reschedule" and you don't lose your appointment until you confirm another. Keep refreshing, I've seen appointments open on the same day even for JJ if after that.
@McConvilleVT I didn't even know Walmart was an option yet in Vermont. Was this via the state run site? Or through Walmart directly? if the state site, usually it will specify single/double see pic, but if double could be either M or P. I'm quite good at the game, tons of practice so far w/fam https://t.co/R78szNEhjo
The "find a pharmacy appointment game" is not unique to Vermont! https://t.co/q00NmFqyhp
Big album cover vibes from this photo of my grandfather and uncle. https://t.co/7xwBj5nv7W
@MLB @RedSox @nikediamond These are sharp as hell, and I loathe this team.
Good news for bike riders between Essex &amp; Colchester a new path is coming! This should help the sketchy stretch of r15 at the Fort via @EssexReporter https://t.co/sgbioB9S8I
It‚Äôs amazing how much impact two lives had on a community. We‚Äôre all so connected here even if we‚Äôre unaware of it.
@NWSBurlington Gimme the heat https://t.co/kkRNdmhCZw
Goals. https://t.co/IxPLHRfwU9
These motherfuckers can‚Äôt all take off at the same fucking time? I‚Äôm trying to watch Hemingway up in here.
In case you forgot, night flying. https://t.co/mkQwzvgMhx

One of the neighbor kids almost got away. It had a chance, it toddlered its way down the street in hopes of finding a new life, alas it was found by its mother, sad.
@kevinbcarter I worked security at the Elton John show, what a brilliant gig to get paid to see! My first show there was 94 (Metallica, of course) but I've seen Ethridge, ZZ Top, Weezer, Neil Young, and a whole bunch I'm surely forgetting. I'd go see just about ANYTHING at this point.
@foundbeautyvt @lovecrossbones Eternally frustrating. I just don't get it. We've been through this dozens of times in history, its one of the reasons we're even here.
Can you hear the music? https://t.co/slydD9VPEd
Concerts, this summer are...possible. https://t.co/fmMHGnz6nL
Finish line in sight. https://t.co/nft9TOexYr https://t.co/3sfXZ39zF8
Otherwise folks are all coming out in various stages of happiness and relief. Some cheering to nobody, others hugging, etc.. you love to see it.
Some whack job just came out from getting the jab at the fairgrounds yelling and swearing to himself that he was ‚Äúgonna fucking kill that kid‚Äù  Must have only got 4G.
@DaveSilberman @jenrosesmithvt Yep, often available when I get up around 5 or 5:30, they might load them earlier than that even. Good luck!
Ketchup shortage you say? I‚Äôve got several vintages stored for such an occasion. I take Venmo and PayPal FF. https://t.co/z9mPmBef1N
Bennington remains forever, the rest are taken. Make sure you cancel your other appointment after you've got the goods. https://t.co/0cpHTwQnap
South Burlington, Williston, and Essex still open as of 7:49am for shots this week. (and Bennington, but Bennington is ALWAYS available)
@BrennanNeillVT Yessssssss! https://t.co/oHjyFrwjYZ
@NatronVT Woot! Don‚Äôt forget to cancel the state one after you get the juice! Boom! https://t.co/qdT1HXQIon
@KStapleton_BTV Alright! https://t.co/u0vJLgV1nU
@cmjmoroney @RealMattLucia https://t.co/kdvgH1Z1KR
Saturday J&amp;J available @BrennanNeillVT or anyone else https://t.co/s5xpVWrlux
Happy Tuesday y‚Äôall, go to CVS right now #btv area if you need to schedule or upgrade your jab to this week or next!!! #OurShotVT https://t.co/jxSLOhNCcO
@TheLoungeKing Tremendous! https://t.co/84NFEQS7w8
@takeanotherswig This is on my list! Looks great!
