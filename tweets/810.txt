@emylerpafford A long dress with rips and tears in it and she was just standing in the corner looking at me
@emylerpafford See it wasn’t sleep paralysis I was fully awake and was able to move but it was a bald skinny white man with tattoos that streaked across the left side of his face he was wearing a white t-shirt and black jeans, the woman in the corner was a white female long brown hair wearing
Serious question: How does one go about a seance? I was in bed awake last night w/lights off and saw a man standing next to my bed I turned the light on he was gone then 20 minutes later had the light off again and he was standing in my doorway and a woman was in the corner......
