What I’m saying is go after the institutions not the tax payers to bail you out. The money comes from somewhere and the surplus definitely isn’t within the American people..
You’re tellin me college football alone doesn’t bring in enough money to support the students that go to these schools?? Think of other avenues of lowering educational costs before bailing out the people that in reality need it the least..
I’m all for lower educational costs. But asking working class people to pay in taxes for the group of people that have the highest income and employment rates in the country seems kind of redundant. I understand it’s tough taking loans at 18 but. Don’t pay it. Make it accessible
@craymusic I hope he said please
