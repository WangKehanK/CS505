@Owen70636385 @jeeftheflame @misophon @Struggle_Tweet if the the word “uncultured” was a person lmao
why is it pet smart and not pets mart
@Countwells @zacharieslmsn @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary it should be your parents lecturing you lol at least that’s how it was when i was 12
@jmease @Countwells @zacharieslmsn @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary any landlord who is “working class” is making a terrible investment. in every sense
@zacharieslmsn @Countwells @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary he won’t understand cause his worldview is that of a child lol
@Countwells @zacharieslmsn @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary lol riiight. survival needs shouldn’t be an incentive to work. survival needs should be a given because the opposite would imply...(this is where you can finish the sentence bud)
@Countwells @zacharieslmsn @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary never really advocated for “everything” to be free lol and you say i have the worldview of a child 🙄
@Countwells @zacharieslmsn @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary i rly just think poor people don’t deserve to live huh
@Countwells @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary hopefully, for the sake of any person going through an eviction like that, we’ll soon have the empathy to actually provide subsidized housing. i’m not sure why you guys think a landlord gouging profit from their tenants is a good thing. y’all like the taste of boots that much???
@Countwells @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary as opposed to dinosaurs building their houses? lmao. i think the medieval/feudal times are good enough, you know, where the concept of “landlord” kinda... originated lol.
@jmease @Countwells @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary y’all can’t even be bothered to learn the origin of the whole “landlord” concept lmao
@Countwells @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary LOLOL what were people doing before landlords existed, genius? 😭💀
@zacharieslmsn @Countwells @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary it’s crazy that we really could compromise. we can have landlords doing their shitty little thing while also having a system that provides *subsidized* and *well maintained* public housing for those who are in need of it. but the world hates poor people so what can ya do 🤷🏽‍♂️
@Countwells @jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary to answer your question, i’d stay with my parents lol. but my point was more that landlords aren’t a necessity. “There are no landlords” lol they don’t provide living space. that already existed before them. they just own the space and charge you hella for it. leechy.
@jmease @Floss_da_Jawz @Countwells @SarahJaneHugsU @ohbabv @TeeThirtyFour @itsdannyneary ...you do realize housing can exist without landlords right
@brishyaa__ this too cute i’m finna fucking cry 😭 congrats!!

@_feiloakitau well yeh but starting out with a huge amount of money makes it exponentially easier to grow. and makes you waaaaaay more willing to working at it/taking risks/failing/etc. starting with money plays a bigger role than you think
@_feiloakitau amazon is not a billion dollar idea lol not gonna give him that credit. it’s a multi-billion dollar corporation for sure tho. i’m willing to bet anything that bezos/amazon would be nothing without that initial investment from his parents, hard work or not
@_feiloakitau jesse, his parents invested $250k in his shit back in 1995. the mf STARTED OUT rich. easy to “work” for your money when you start with that much
at least they minding they own business unlike somebody... https://t.co/SeSlDkNUwf

@_feiloakitau fr peta need to delete they whole existence smh
@_feiloakitau lmaoooo i got problems pronouncing it too 🤷🏽‍♂️ it means to give non-human shit human like characteristics tho. ain’t no damn fish or snake taking a knee lol they ain’t even got knees to begin with 😭
“respect animals” but y’all strip their uniqueness by anthropomorphizing the shit out of them (?) and peta using kaepernick to further an equality-for-all-animals agenda (????) Black people really mean nothing to y’all huh. trash. https://t.co/KKu0QOzq7k
and that racist ass mf can keep rolling smh https://t.co/eueOKutdyA
@Kyd_Nugen “chosen one” https://t.co/kU6PWW2CmK
@Kyd_Nugen easy. virginity 😎
@nativeyums i know i know. it’s just that his life philosophy reached a lot of us where it mattered most. i’m sorry some people are saying nasty things to you. i wish they’d discuss their grievances w your tweet instead of throwing insults at you. not fair at all.
@nativeyums these people shouldn’t be coming after you like this but let us all mourn in peace man :/
@Khajin3 so no, i don’t think we should ignore everyone who disagrees with us. never said that. i said sensible people are more inclined to ignore hostilities made towards them by completely random strangers.
@Khajin3 “unfriendly opposition” makes sense. opposition doesn’t necessarily have to unfriendly. like civil discourse. “unfriendly hostility” is redundant because hostility implies the unfriendliness.
@Khajin3 i haven’t assumed anything. been following your logic this whole time lol “opposition” is only partially true b/c “hostility” implies unfriendliness. it’s an unfriendly opposition. you can’t detach the unfriendliness part from hostility, it’ll lose it’s meaning.
@Khajin3 i’m assuming? hostility can be defined as unfriendliness. which is what you did aint it? since saying condescending shit is a hostility. and wasn’t you JUST talking about not being friendly? i don’t have to assume shit when i been taking everything you been saying 😂 cmon bruh
@Khajin3 so you lookin for a hostile discussion? bro if a completely random stranger came at you w hostilities, would you realistically respond? cause i think any sensible person would walk away lol
@gg_xcviii LMAOOO u ain’t even have to do him like that 😭
@Khajin3 you just said you was prepared to have a discussion though. what happened to that lmao
@Khajin3 you didn’t expect the opportunity to elaborate? so again...what’s your point at all lmao
@Khajin3 you can’t insult people or their position and expect them to give you space to elaborate. disagree with whatever you want but you should at least start with constructive dialogue.
@Khajin3 lmfao oook bud. “ain’t the end of the world” in this highly subjective context isn’t criticism. you’re only downplaying other people’s perspectives. criticism has some actual justification attached to it. otherwise it’s just an insult. you can criticize w/o being a dick
@Khajin3 bro what. we can’t be talking about the same thing. i’m saying something can be a big deal to one person and not so much to someone else. “it ain’t the end of the world” in that sense don’t hold value.
@Khajin3 explicitly choosing not to understand something because you don’t agree with it? ain’t that just willful ignorance. white girl mouthed “nigga” and was criticized for it so...i still don’t see your point
@Khajin3 @PrvncessNari @cinnamonkatt nah dawg you just gotta understand people got different perspectives from your own
@Khajin3 @PrvncessNari @cinnamonkatt a molehill is pretty big if you put your eye right up next to it. perspectives are relative my guy one person’s molehill can be someone else’s mt. everest
@Khajin3 @PrvncessNari @cinnamonkatt you right. only the end of the world is the end of the world so what’s your point lol
