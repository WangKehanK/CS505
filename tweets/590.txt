*gets a reverb pedal and a delay pedal with a looper, nails a progression, puts down the guitar and sits on the couch for awhile and let's it drone* lookit me ma, I'm playing guitar
@Wanderlynx I got a Joyo R-14! Thing's got some neat sounds tucked away in it!
@PeeperSuper Dull but kinda scratchy I reckon
Ooh got my reverb pedal in *rubs hooves together*

Gorgeous thunderstorm tonight. Perfect evening &lt;3
@HYENABLOOD @Tonya_Song I own a bucket I should be good
@Tonya_Song @HYENABLOOD If either of y'all would like to play sometime I'd be honored

@3amepiphany @Hey_Its_Lollie @deervvitch https://t.co/WIBr6nkNDB
@Hey_Its_Lollie @deervvitch I am extremely obviously the latter and you know it
@vpvrtment @deervvitch Ty so much!! ü¶å‚ù§ü¶å
@jdl_art @deervvitch Aaaaaaaaa!
When two queer deer marry...sheer power...
@CaptainErsatz @deervvitch The forest will be raucous in it's celebrations!!
@MervynFoxe @deervvitch YOU-
Asked @deervvitch if they'd marry me and they said yes ‚ù§üå±
@HYENABLOOD @JoofWoof You gotta hop on board my man! Give yourself some TLC = Teal Lead Comfort
@Kavaeric So a singular theme through which to unify the characters, stories, world and overall flavor of that universe?
How do y'all go about world-building?
I keep alluding to it and eventually I'll have to make it a thing, y'know?
June working on a mech with a deadline of...10 minutes ago. https://t.co/7j8IAb6WJE
"If it sounds good, it is good" didn't seem to help them
Remembering when @deervvitch was sitting on the couch listening to Cake and they just ask to the open air "...Is Cake good?"
Happy friday y'all
@skonk Right? Some hometown pride right there! NY buddy wants the thermae really bad
@SandraMJdev Just straight beef Jerky in a parking lot at sunset yaaaaa
@MEATTAIL Yeah
@KurtTransem Biiiiig mood
Here's a demo from the always excellent @Knobs_Demos  https://t.co/tKMd2kFT8W
@cckatoo Your characters and color work always impress. Huge mood here, lovely work &lt;3
Also uh...Soon. üëÄüí¶ https://t.co/ZxIsU1Jqvf
@SandraMJdev No one really catches it if you say "throw my hat at the ring," if that helps
@HYENABLOOD Aw yeah we're just vibing https://t.co/aNeLg168Di
@HYENABLOOD Oh shit you too?!
@kioxk Same hat
Nothing makes you doubt your ability to keep time more than learning how to use a loop pedal.
"Yeah, I accessorize, look-" *plugs in a teal guitar cord*
@zMASKm Hell yeah do it
@HYENABLOOD looks like the perfect tool for the job too, tbh
@Padlock_music If it helps: every single time this has happened to me the fix has been to remove parts from those sections rather than change or add anything. That stuff works too obviously but just In my experience this has ended up being "the fix"
Thank all of you so goddamned much. I couldn't do this without you. I'll keep trying.
@whaddit A profoundly fun and deeply interesting listen, thank you for sharing this &lt;3
Holy shit thank y'all? ü¶å‚ù§üéµüôè https://t.co/QP2ij5ZQrh
@junkie_church Thank you so damn much, I'm gonna keep going &lt;3
Whew.
And if you haven't picked it up yet (or there's older work of mine you've yet to pick up), today's a hella good day to get my new record given that it's @Bandcamp Friday and they're waving their revenue share! https://t.co/yyLcPWkNaK
@TheAllSceneEye Shouts to @mollydrag and @fennec_peachy, @SeaToger and @deervvitch for their help &lt;3
LRT the interview I did with Taylor at @TheAllSceneEye was really warm and cozy, even though I prattle on a bit. Check it out, I'm privileged to be in such fine company covered on that blog &lt;3
@TheAllSceneEye Thank you so much &lt;3
@YesThisIsMerp @Bandcamp Thank you so much ü•∫üôè‚ù§ü¶åüéµ
@Signilike Thank you so damn much &lt;3
VERY strong gremlin vibes today lads
@FlamingoMyMango This is beyond fun!! &lt;3
It's @Bandcamp Friday! Any purchase made goes entirely to the artists today - I put out a new album a week ago if you'd like to support me - and there's over ten years worth of other music there, too! ü¶åüéµ‚ù§ https://t.co/yyLcPWkNaK

@LyraMeli Toan embiggener
Update: it RIPS. can't wait to loop some weirdness out of it.
@mollydrag Looking forward to hearing it‚ù§
Maybe some guitar ambience shows, maybe something more - lots to explore and tinker with.
Just got this notif today too. Excited to explore what can be done! https://t.co/btiGnTJTvv
@WITCHMOUSE666 Hell yeah that's the way
Shouts to @jhspedals, super excited to rip on this
Furry guitarists should be mandated to have a fuzz box on their board.

@vpvrtment Holy shit your illustrations &lt;3
