I’m sorry this tweet wasn’t bird-related. Just as a reminder I still don’t like birds
So who else sleeps by wrapping themselves up in a blanket/sheet as if it were a cocoon, with only their nose poking out for air? Asking for a friend
Thinking about switching over to Parler. I know that’s where all the morons go but at least their mascot isn’t a bird
I was excited about watching Falcon and the Winter Soldier until I learned that a falcon is in fact a bird. Therefore I will not be watching. Please let me know when they release just The Winter Soldier, without any birds involved.
As it turns out, a hokie is a bird. Fortunately it seems as though @virginia_tech hates birds as much as I do
@alexxlou348 He is the exception
Reminder: my profile is not a safe space for bird lovers
The 12 days of Christmas would be way better without all those birds
@catherinegv19_ That is a question
Followers please take note that this is now a bird hate account. If you aren’t looking for anti-bird content please vacate the premises
I have decided that I do not like birds. I will be taking no questions at this time
@crixare4kids I do what I can
I will not be participating in white boy summer this year. That is all
Convinced that Helen Keller is a myth perpetrated by Big Disability
One day I’ll call 1-800-WIN-WIN-1 and I’ll show them. I’ll show them all

Hey @LeaderMcConnell just wanted to ask how you came to the conclusion that Clinton lying about a BJ was worthy of a vote for conviction but trump inciting a deadly insurrection on the steps of the Capitol wasn’t? Just curious about your thought process there, plz show your work
History will remember those 43 as spineless, cowardly traitors. Never forget.

@intheALLY Pandemic does not equal summer break 🚫
I’m not sure what school system Phineas and Ferb went to but I want in, 104 days of summer vacation sounds pretty tight

Twitter flagging every one of trump’s election tweets https://t.co/e3QXFh8UKv
@crixare4kids Oh yeah I knew that I’m so silly
@crixare4kids Insomnia cookies?
Time to piss off a few relatives with my new Ridin’ With Biden 2020 shirt😁
In a hypothetical future apocalyptic scenario my designated bug-out location is the Living With the Land greenhouses at Disney’s Epcot, how bout y’all
@blonded808s At the time he taught history and Spanish, now he just teaches history

trump has finally run into a problem he can’t lie or buy his way out of

If Philly ends up deciding this election I’m going to be an honorary Eagles fan this season
Oh yeah and if you voted for trump unfollow me you’re a piece of shit☺️
No matter how this election turns out, it’s clear we didn’t learn our lesson. Extremely disappointed
In case anyone else needs to numb the pain and despair during the debate tonight https://t.co/A1f7hAbNRx

Not my meme but wanted y’all to see this one😂 https://t.co/sYzCFuJUNh
And no, I’m not excited about this ticket. Neither Biden nor Harris were even in my top 5 candidates. BUT both are miles better than Trump, and I’m willing to overlook their weaknesses in order to vote out the disaster currently in the White House. I hope you all do the same.
#BidenHarris2020 🗳
@BreelynGreer I have no memory of this whatsoever so you’re all good😂 and I’m glad some people appreciate my thoughts, hope you’re doing well too!
@Rennoc360 The Electoral College is severely outdated. Under the EC, when Texas flips blue a Republican won’t see the White House for decades. I can’t wait to watch the tables turn within the next 8 years and watch the GOP scramble to abolish the EC, but by then it’ll be too late for them
It’ll be hilarious to watch Republicans do a sharp 180 on their views about the Electoral College once Texas flips blue in 2024 or 2028
2 people died of Ebola on American soil under the Obama administration and the Right was in an uproar. As we approach 150k American Covid deaths due in large part to the trump administration’s disastrous pandemic response, the Right remains silent. VOTE THEM OUT

@SpenceGarnowski Where is the dislike button
@SpenceGarnowski This ain’t it chief
Another attempt by the clown-in-chief to shift the blame for his failure on the pandemic response onto someone else. This is an extremely irresponsible and reckless move, and it’s saddening that it’s become a partisan issue. Both sides of the aisle should be condemning this. https://t.co/Ws1I0emTqJ
DMing trump cultists to see how they react is my favorite American pastime
I beg everyone to read and share this article. https://t.co/KTm0m2YzCS
@blonded808s Not to mention a blatant lie https://t.co/DijKoGvJvD
I find it interesting that college kids with limited funds tend to tip better than wealthy boomers
Imagine being so deluded that you sincerely believe trump is religious and represents Christian values😂
Y’all remember climbing ropes in elementary school gym? What were they training us for🤔

Idk who needs to hear this but the results of elections held during a pandemic are not valid ‼️
Liberty hasn’t made their classes online yet...I guess it helps that they practice social distancing all the time anyways
