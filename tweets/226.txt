Quarantine Day 4: went MIA and watched season one of Cheers. Happy late Easter!
Just finished all 3 seasons of Ozark &amp; rarely does a show make my jaw DROP. Canâ€™t wait for season 4 ðŸ¤ª
Further updates: ate food and now am watching Godzilla vs. Kong. Not so bad yet â€” missing work though (imagine that).
Just read this text from my younger brother... looks like what Iâ€™m missing out on in College Station. https://t.co/JPTw0YxHdC
Since my uncles need more content... Shoe was returned and placed outside my door. It was not returned in sport mode. I have yet to eat breakfast and have been watching Facebook videos like a 50 year old woman. Stay tuned folks ðŸ˜Œ
Quarantine Day One Thread   Roommates dog just stole my Croc and ran. I have zero energy to chase him. He needs to switch them to sport mode ðŸ¤§
I have COVID. Unfortunately, this is not an April Foolâ€™s joke. Should I devote my entire Twitter page for the next 10 days on how quarantine for an extrovert goes? You tell me, 3 followers of mine who are active on this app!
If you can play the guitar solo in Hotel California marry me please.
