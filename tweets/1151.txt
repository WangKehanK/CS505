Everything in my life is looking up currently but I still have my moments. Just have to keep positive thoughts and patience.

@2epub What time y’all playing?
Am I cool enough to game with the cool kids?
PTSD stemming from my Mom’s death really changed me to a point where I don’t even know myself sometimes. I don’t even get regular sad about small things anymore, I get depressed. I just wish I didn’t have to feel this way. It’s painful and it zaps all of the energy I have.
Anyone know of any good hotels that have great Valentine’s Day Packages? This is my first time doing this😅 so I just want to get this right😁
@VixenTM I definitely do
I just wish I could have a talk with my Mom, Aunt and Grandpa. They were really my peace and they didn’t even know it😞
I’m not in a good mood rn😞
Need a woman’s advice on something
I’m a giant fuck up sometimes😞🤦🏽‍♂️
I think I might just be done gaming in general.

I’m playing some pubs with the fam, come hangout💯  https://t.co/WExHlEvhwO https://t.co/pehKYxaChc
@NBA2K @Beluba PLEASE MAKE THE REC 85OVR and up please. There should be no reason people come to the Rec to troll with 60-79OVR builds. It has to stop!!!! It ruins the fun of the rec and the competitiveness because they don’t want to play MyCareer or put any VC on their players.
I’m so proud of all of my friends. Stay true to yourself, stay down and put your faith first. One love✌🏽
I need someone who can do an animated and regular logo for me. Reply or DM ASAP. Thank you😁

@The_Bio_Broly @Polyick Thanks bro, I appreciate it
@Polyick Damn I’ve really been out the loop for a min now😅
If I leave twitch and go to another platform, what should it be? *This isn’t 100% me leaving but I will keep my options open. So vote away family‼️
Doing a test stream from the series X Come on over and hangout with me  https://t.co/WExHlEvhwO
Kids just don’t want to adapt and actually learn the game and enjoy this amazing product we have received. Nothing will ever be perfect but this is an amazing start https://t.co/ASnTQJuXMe
@PaullShii 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@PaullShii Bro I was in tears
Tf can you do??? https://t.co/1OwiENAsbJ
@PaullShii 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/IFcbjX0kXM
@TheMetalizer Thanks my guy
@TheMetalizer @NfiniteCyborg That’s the one I have, I wanted to use it with my pc and Xbox at the same time though
@NfiniteCyborg No adapter
@NfiniteCyborg I just have the TR
Anyone with the series X please help me setup my mixamp with it and my pc.
@ThatzAwkwrd Bet, I’ll check that out. I’ve never really streamed on YT before but I guess it will make my channel grow also😁
@Compensate_ Everyday we wakeup will always be a better day brotha🙏🏽
@Compensate_ Bro what has twitch become
@Compensate_ Bro what kind of world are we living in😩
I have exciting things in store for everyone once I get my system and start streaming. 2020 has been a shit show but one thing it did was make me more focused than ever, I’m blessed for that.
So if I stream 2K and the music they have in game plays on stream, I can be at risk for channel deletion or a dmca strike?
It’s 1:28am, the city is shutting back down and I still don’t have my Series X. The walls are closing in everyone
