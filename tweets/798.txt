@diggstape how it feel knowing hop the worst in the big 10?
Low key getting good at this stringing thing @EastCoastDyes https://t.co/dNEN8MMUU8
@CvanRaaphorst Ok so if you land in the goal mouth the Goal will automatically be waved off no matter what, and if you jump in it its going the other way. If you were pushed into it, it’s a penalty on the defense, but still the goal is waved off.
And y’all mfs were like, “Carolina gonna win fs, no doubt about it” https://t.co/gAoiP9BKJc
@thecreasedive When the football kid decided it’ll be a good idea to play lacrosse
@FlowGo37 Agreed. I feel like it’s the only solution to the problem without starting WWIII
@FlowGo37 Appreciate you for bringing this up man, I haven’t seen anyone in the lacrosse community bring it up. Thank you again 🙏🏼

@RustyCox17 @Ovrnundr @trvisXX Bro he’s literally stated that he was Muslim many many times and the ha “prays 20 times a day”, implying that hes a good Muslim. If I were not following the religion and saw this video of a pretty darn famous Muslim man drinking I’d get a terrible representation of the religion
@Ovrnundr @trvisXX What a great representation of the Muslim community 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

@mccldani98 @PremierLacrosse So you have a really good idea on how to run a offense man 💀💀
@mccldani98 @PremierLacrosse Bro honestly tho how they gonna run their offense when they have guys coming in and out of the box 24/7? Also I’m a atlas fan lmaooooo
@PremierLacrosse Chaos 100%, idk how the archers is gonna run their attack with that many elite attackmen
@LakeShowYo 121-115 Lakers
@officiallaxgirl Nah It don’t matter. Just make sure they have a good pocket in their stick and they should be good
@ThePLLPearl 2 v 3s are always good. Have a goalie start with the ball, every player on gle. 3 lines of o and 2 lined of d. Have the o sprint up to midfield and when they turn around the goalie clears it. The moment the goalie throws the 2 d can come in and the 2v3 starts.
@ClemsonLacrosse Man if only y’all were d1, that would be insane. Imagine osu vs. Clemson in lax
@BadgerLocal @thecreasedive Worst take I’ve seen all day
@nojumper Do jojo got a strap tho?
