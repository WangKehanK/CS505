but i’m thankful for Josh taking me out of the house &amp; making me laugh and forget what I was thinking! 🤞🏽❣️
my mental health has been the best i’ve been since like summer 2019 but today man.... I felt like I was in 2016 🌪

learn to communicate with your partner in a healing/healthier way! i’ve learned that talking when you’re mad or sad doesn’t help anything! take a couple day write down what you wanna say &amp; then address the situation. things will be handled and said a lot differently
it’s been 4 days so far &amp; i’m feeling greatttt 🥰
no alcohol, no nicotine &amp; no negative energy or drama 🥰
I pray that this month detox that i’ve been committed to doing helps me like I want it to so bad 🥺 like I need this for myself &amp; my mental health!

it’s sad that nowadays when you try and take a break from friends, family or even social media, someone is always gonna feel attacked bc ur not talking to them... sometimes you just a mental &amp; physical break from everyone.. &amp; no one did anything, it’s just you wanting a break
@Semrraaa_ thought I was the only one 🥴 or even worst having old pictures hidden and looking at them again
