@DreamCa59479541 @zacandrewclark @CecebetterCCme Nah 10 years, McDonaldâ€™s is already phasing out their cashiers. Sams club, you can just scan your goods and walk out. The only thing thatâ€™s keeping cashiers/frontline workers is, people who like to talk to others.
@Adam_1807 @ClearlyaKing @ModernWarzone MW mp is decent at best because of the smooth feeling of the new engine. CW, they took a step back, and used a old engine which clunky movements. For granted, their development time got cut in half. On top of that, heavy SBMM ruins the game
@headlikahole @lynsoar
@__KLKJ @hjslatte Or skipped school to see these shows
@QeWZee_ @ttvitzgrff @daltoosh Tbh Attack on Titan is not a beginner show to get into anime. I would say Hero Academia is probably on of the best anime to start off with. Cliche and basic to its core, and fun to watch.
@REALVanderwood @ackerhoestan @Rinnamon__Roll You can fish at the beach. Seen people do it and Iâ€™ve done it too. Pretty fun and chill
@noahIol I wish I could find my childhood neighbors ðŸ˜« now we live in a different state
@Mikekemp1192 @racenut548 @MrGFromJersey @CNBC I work at a fast food restaurant to get me through college, most of my coworkers are high schoolers or just graduated from highschool
@pinkynicky64 @TECHNOSOOT The problem is, the teachers donâ€™t know how to use discord. Discord is becoming extremely popular amongst kids &amp; young adults because itâ€™s the #1 source for game chat.
@TECHNOSOOT It would be so much organized though if the teacher is tech savy. And it allows teachers to have more control in their lessons. If a kid is causing trouble, yeet them to a timeout vc or mute them and the kid isnâ€™t allowed to unmute themselves w/o admin role unlike zoom
@lacosa808 @TAQUEETS @JAYVERSACE Itâ€™s obvious why homeless people canâ€™t take care of a home. They canâ€™t go to a rehab, they have no money for it, and theyâ€™re not stable enough to upkeep a house regardless
@lacosa808 @TAQUEETS @JAYVERSACE Government really need to start putting more funds into the mental health facilities. Mental illness is a leading cause of homelessness b/c theyâ€™re not stable enough to keep a job and mental hospitals wonâ€™t take them in. Itâ€™s a loose loose situation.
@thewiseturtle @Lexistansrih I mean, parents have to force their child to go to school or police/child services will knock on their door. Homeschool is not a option for a lot of families too. Blame the system, not the parents
@thetankbarron12 @Dominos137 @Fizzyloser @Treyarch Never gotten a ray gun from there but is nice to get a guaranteed jug
@CuseSZN @CouRageJD Its not the devs that putting sbmm in the game. Itâ€™s Activision themselves
@VAMPV1RUS I am barely keeping my head over water rn. 70s is the best Iâ€™ll get in this semester. ðŸ˜© I really wish they email all assignments to us instead of individually checking each of my 5 classes if I have anything due
@NavileApril I believe this but Iâ€™m trying to find where it says on the bill on https://t.co/dlZWvzGjqC site
@Cashew41601 @CouRageJD You do realize under the Tax cut and jobs act (2017), Trump was going to raise taxes on the middle class in 2021
@jergi21 @yunhophobe But AZ is officially blue since yesterday
@bruddamane_ @954jeffx @inosukebaby Harrisâ€™s views isnâ€™t so sunshine either. Her prosecution history is super scary with her withholding evidence that would show innocence on a death row inmate. To putting people in prison for marijuana charges. I hope that 2024 candidates are more logical
@Tarushdei @hotchipliar @pcgamer Although, all before the laws on limiting truck drivers hours/miles came in, he used to do 70+ hour weeks on a daily basis with barely any overtime pay. Now, company is treading the line b/c for the past few weeks, heâ€™s done average of 68 hours
@Tarushdei @hotchipliar @pcgamer Dadâ€™s a (concrete) trucker, overtime hits at 40 hours. It might be different for each company though (idk). He never touched 70 hours when the laws and policy came rolling in for truck drivers.
@HappyFunNorm @Tarushdei @hotchipliar @pcgamer Company can make them do 70 hours but itâ€™s also almost impossible to reach 70 hours now. Every time they clock out, company has to give them a 10 hour rest time.
@Tarushdei @hotchipliar @pcgamer I mean, isnâ€™t there policies and laws placed down to where companies making truckers work 70 hours is a big no no. And also 40 hours is where overtime pay kicks in.
@FrozenGaming42 @thedayacure The kids are the ones that are writing it since the videos are on their account....
@Ben53590465 @CouRageJD The masks protects others, not yourself. Thatâ€™s on the fault of other people not wearing the mask so blame the people who didnâ€™t wear a mask in public for your family getting covid
@sloh186 @OephiliaFace @Rebb_93 @kalaxxyy_ @KeithHollandd Many job interviews donâ€™t really require you to dress super formal. A sports bar for example (since thatâ€™s where she got hired) really just want you to wear nice casual clothings.
@frailhouseplant @cryptbabie Technically is but has no blood on his hands. Made other people do the work
@luxuriovs @cryptbabie Itâ€™s actually not a movie, itâ€™s a Netflix show called mindhunters. Really good show
@lilunstable @GlamazonJay @apie105 My mom was like that before she got sober. She wanted me to be a mini her but I donâ€™t want to follow her footsteps. Now she wants the best for me when she finally found a healthy lifestyle
@tek_sauce @jasonschreier @Nibellion Microsoft already made a agreement where all of their games are on steam
@ERocYT @NVIDIAGeForce Because theyâ€™re still getting their money at the end of the day. Probably cost money to even put up a anti bot system
@ERocYT @NVIDIAGeForce Just take a good look at eBay and youâ€™ll see why
@GeMQ23 @Jorductions @nowthisnews What kind of vet are you going to? Blood tests for my cats cost $100 and I consider my vet expensive
@AintthatVann @nowthisnews Heâ€™s a money maker for the zoo. They ainâ€™t putting down a animal that makes them millions
@Pgboyega @passionateMiya @Piinkmelanin That moment Iâ€™m still listed as a dependent at 20.... Sheâ€™s 18, she can do whatever the fuck she wants anyways
@VlLLAlNlSTS Same, felt like everyone was  older than me then once 18 came, instantly everyone is 15 and younger. I feel like a granny at 20 on twitter
@lynsoar @NVIDIAGeForce I wanna play right now but I canâ€™t ðŸ˜­
@Yournigapikachu @kushb3rry @jamarispeaks The most recent victim was a guy
