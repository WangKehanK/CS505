@Nick_Schmidt09 @aadelsonESPN Can’t ever be 100% truthful about UCF; they always gotta have at least 1 barb.
@aadelsonESPN How is UCF a commuter school with 83% living off campus but FSU with 80% isn’t?
@benshapiro GM employs almost 27,000 black workers as well.
@factcheckdotorg You know you can just say he lied, right?
Has anyone else looked at UCF's schedule this year and realized we play 9 consecutive games?
@TJ_Pittinger Yeah, everyone who is fully COVID vaccinated who still wears masks should follow lockdown quarantine till COVID completely goes away.
@edsbs And 2018.
@TheDozenTrivia Rosters should lock now. If Ziti makes it in this should be their playoff roster. You can’t allow someone to refuse to play a match and still get in.

@NICKMERCS @timthetatman Kinda ironic how Tim got a sponsorship from a back support chair company the day before his 60th birthday.
