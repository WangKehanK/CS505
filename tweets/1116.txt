@RebeccaHarden9 Thank you
@Agent4MassGov @duopoliesrdumb Exactly we were all alive and well I was typically the bigger and scary guy until people spoke to me but I get it because there were some real scary cats back in the day but still hell to the yes 100% ALIVE not just existing
@Agent4MassGov @duopoliesrdumb I miss those days greatly. Days when it was fun even though it was scary and things fit and belonged and though there was rage it was never really hate.

Well after some minor set backs, getting ill, a trip to the hospital and a slow recovery the day finally happened. Hope everyone is well https://t.co/ATBYo7Dovd
