@NormalFire Congrats!
@BenFolds in re: "…gimme something I can break": the law, when 1) under scrutiny, 2) unjust, 3) implemented w/o affirmation from each under such, 4) when all is well, seeking confirmation. Sweeping change via thy testimony in a court of law is the way. I'm Normal-adjacent. 😇
#Pendantry: The phrasing is “[Memorandum of] receipt,” when written. Akin to “[memorandum of] deed,” or “[memorandum of] constitution.” Be at liberty to drop the square brackets—not what’s inside each set, tho. “Words” and “phrases;” not “term(s)”; mote “be!”
@kaydacode “EE. UU.” has this “Latinate” in a small amount of contentedness. 🤓🤩

@elonmusk My vehicle isn’t “car,” primarily, no. Rucksack? Carry? Ped[estrian]? Ambulatory? Ganesha’s vehicle is a mouse. Which method of propulsion does thy dexter “big toe” direct the most? Walkers drive the nation. Foot power (a hand’s power to walk toward sunset), first!
@justthisguy I believe Bitcoin’s worth has been proven on a level way, way far out there (which sounds as “science fiction” when described, as yet). “Laundering,” in my consideration of the issue, isn’t the right term, with the baggage/connotation held popularly.
@justthisguy I watched a story once wherein a hotel in Hot Springs, Arkansas would collect the coin of the realm from the cashbox each night and wash—to luster—the coinage for providing to customers—just one aspect of the hospitality provided by the place.
@WaffleHouse And how to be, rather than “not a stranger,” a “regular? Does Waffle House provide careers for long-term continuity of relation with those persons served? Or is hiring those who “just need:a job” pá “pay the bills” acceptable for hire? (Big fan here; wish y’all were in Illinois!)
@bb_scientist “People” are inert writings—handbooks/manuals for persons to adopt/better thru time. Call out the person; a coward hiding behind too-easy pseudonymity. Do as you do, baby boy—and smile big!
@elonmusk That isn’t “‘E’:Good,” Mr. Musk. God is divesting Himself from the Deity “farçade,” and “looking for [minuscule] “god(s)” with a known-faulty “backward,” “secret decoder ring” is a problem. You don’t want problems, do you? “Slide into my DMs” [?] for mores, sil vous plait.
I don’t have a resonance with the tweet, now. Also, emoticons in 2012? Doesn’t seem like me. Fakery? “Senbei” (“rice cracker”) isn’t resonant with at-hand experience of employ.

@NormalFire Was a passenger train derailed in Normal? Who would be tasked with the root cause analysis?
@oliviataters Ambidexterity; this Hand of God on Earth has “both” as “right” (with no further involvement as to “sinister” nor “dexter” nor “handedness”). Where’s thy skin, Olivia?
@oliviataters Import a Swiss watch-maker. Learn that which powered complications, originally: A single spring, wound by a watchman. (Right?)
Warby Parker no longer sells the monocle. Still, I would like one. Tortoiseshell coloring/patterning pleases in this.

@EckhartTolle Especially bad with “aural hallucinations” (“unsound effects” and voices without faith—neither face nor feet). Any advice?
@oliviataters The phrase “honest question” implies  that one’s baseline level of words is not to be trusted. That’s why friendly folk “affirm” each’s truth rather than “swear up and down” (neglecting “on the level”).
Howdy, @_grammarist. I am willing yet unable to find the way to comment on articles of the website. Is this by design? I have a question regarding the word "compulsed" (if it's a word), and how it would relate to "compel" and "impel." Please advise.

@ericasadun Is she into the “slow food movement”? If you’d like to present experiences rather than artifacts, it may be that a visit to a local, organic, family-owned farm would be a better way to signify such. Remember the “Toy Yoda” debacle. 😔

@chemlesbian Wonderful that we remember that professors are the human outgrowth of academia, and ultimately they have the power to allow ascendence regardless of "grading policy" of the University. Curving—even in instances of plain favoritism—happens, tho is seldom looked-upon with approval.

@CoinFlipATM Just Bitcoin. I don’t trust (yet) those “programmable” blockchains. Waiting for a good system to allow widespread adoption of “n-of-m” transactions, first; serving human enterprise before “machined,” please!
I blame those who don’t meet (spatiotemporally-congruent environ) those from whom they accept wares for the #SolarWinds “hack.” It’s a valid, expected, awaited outgrowth of adoption of SSL without Personal Certs instead of user/pass pairs. Remember “PGP Key-Signing Parties” well!

@paulmorrisTIM Thanks. Marking this #ToWatch, tho don’t sell yourself short; your films capture a deep-seated part of maleness that resounds deeply in me, yet is as-yet “unmentionable.” More life in your scenes than most films have the guts to explore. Oh, and I like yr “puzzling” images.

@andrei_matei “A whiff of plastique with a hint of finger-oil.” How do you account for the nose? Smell-o-Vision?
@elonmusk Information has the ability to escape its black hole of origin.
@SpaceX @elonmusk Starman (1984) made plain that "yellow light" does not indicate "go faster." Likewise, Starman was to come meet us, when he'd no longer "blow our minds."
@elonmusk Real eyes realize real lies. "Naughty" is a confusing term, and indicates backward-in-time-applied labeling of something which may have been standard practice. If "naughty" (of naught), then the only oppressor is one's own fear of runaway hierarchy.
@elonmusk Perhaps salad dressing is more to thy liking.
@elonmusk "Shoulding" on others, Mr. Musk, is not the way of Peace.
@elonmusk No. Tho different; neither ugly nor better, simply shifted to a larger magnitude; the opposite of decimation. The "secret to life, the universe, and everything" is 42, not a hazy, purple miasma which 420 represents. More isn't better, especially when "counting" isn't visual.
@elonmusk "Presently" preferred. "Soon" has that "fear looms large" in the minds of some who've used "soon" as a threat.
@elonmusk This leads one to consider the case against space travel, Mr. Musk. Until you can engineer rail-gun, space elevator, and Dyson ring around the Earth, there's no reason to go, and plenty of reason to reform Earth to be a shrine of available resource for the young.
@_grammarist: I've read your entry on petroglyph versus pictograph; I ask for the contrast of the proper use of "pictogram."  I am writing to make plain my preference for Apple's Japanese keyboard layout, which eschews labeling "return" and "enter" in favor of a single symbol.
@ourdailybread @Letters4theLord ODB: Have you yet secured the process of providing the quarterly devotionals to prisons (without staples)? I’m brown and, thus, face a higher probability of incarceration. Would like to know you could reach me in prison!
@paulmorrisTIM Let’s hope it isn’t like when a perfectly-sized (huge) cock pulls out all the way and that whimpering bottom feels emptiness and desperately begs for more (sexual) congress. Actually, can you make one of your documentary-caliber films featuring that feeling among real men?
@robertjacoby85 Ugh. Being •both• hyperopic •and• myopic doesn’t resolve to Vision. The most-local representation is the most important election. Obsession with the most-distant election, the one you—at best—had 1/6,000,000 of a say in, is lazy and crazy at worst; uninformed, at best.
