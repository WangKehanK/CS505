I know it‚Äôs wasteful and unnecessarily expensive and gimmicky and not even required for skin but I love watching those long ass ‚Äúskincare routine‚Äù tik toks just bc of the sounds that gels and creams make

Being attacked by an angry goose as a child builds character
@TeletubbiesHQ Release the recipe for tubby custard

If the internet connection in my house were a physical being I would strangle it to death for all this grief it is giving me
@alexbethjuarez It has really gone downhill and it‚Äôs only good for the super target which would be way better at cerritos
At first Cerritos was bad bc it had ugly sculptures and boring stores, and Westminster had better ones. But then Cerritos redecorated and got better stores, and Westminster replaced all flooring with CARPET. Now Cerritos good Westminster bad. https://t.co/ETAmHv2M6K
You All Over Me is giving me Sheryl Crow vibes and I love it

The reason the Snyder cut is 4 hours long is because half of it is in slow motion for no reason
The essence of gaming is having an incredibly difficult time playing a game, getting frustrated/dying often yet still calling it your favorite game
@bountay_ What does solidarity mean in this context/conversation?  I‚Äôm trying to understand what the disagreement is
MLs and other revolutionaries need to stop attempting to have extended discussions on Twitter IMO this is not the platform for complex and nuanced issues to be discussed, people too easily misrepresent and misconstrue one another
Like what would be the difference between watching this movie and just actual footage of these actions happening IRL.  Why would a movie like that be entertaining
I am failing to understand why you would take the horrors that black Americans face on the daily, aestheticize them, and put them in a movie as if .. that would somehow make it enjoyable to watch? https://t.co/eOQmGzYTnq
Brought out the pink Lamborghini just to RACE with CHYNA brought the WRAITH to CHINA just to RACE in CHINA

Also huge gillette ad shot by Bruce Wayne
Why is this movie explaining everything to me like I‚Äôm a child
WW in the Synder cut is so terribly bad.  Equally as bad as Whedon‚Äôs.
Maybe I grew up watching too much paranormal reality tv but when an infant points to something that isn‚Äôt there I immediately think of ghosts
Wearing masks more often bc of work is making me break the fuck out

SWIFTIES IM GETTING SCARED
Bey not only came to the Grammy‚Äôs but got on stage AND said something.  We will not see her for years now
You know she probably lip syncing bc it‚Äôs hard to remember which words she can‚Äôt say

Megan doing the leg hold reminds me of myself in HS dance when I couldn‚Äôt hold it as high as everyone else lmaoooooo
