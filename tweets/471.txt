@pghsportskipper I need to splice that song with the Beatles ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Me Down‚Äù
@DarthAmin Blair Rasmussen ain‚Äôt walking through that door #pitinogame
@NaismithLives @NoahCoslov Scoonie Penn mentioned that it‚Äôs a young mans game and that he should have left as a junior. Is there statistical evidence pointing to drafting younger?  I think leadership/experience can outweigh being 1-3 years younger in certain circumstances.
@AAnianoFantasy I owe you a beer for the Parker recommendation üçª
@AAnianoFantasy @JoshHayesFS Thanks for the reply!
@AAnianoFantasy @JoshHayesFS I picked up Parris Campbell because I also have Golladay ü§¶so it‚Äôs a rough start to the year
@JoshHayesFS @AAnianoFantasy hey guys, I need help with a PPR flex start...  I have Dobbins and Ingram DeVante Parker Or  Courtland Sutton   Thanks!
@NoahCoslov So let‚Äôs say they go on to lose the series. Any drastic changes in Boston or try again?  I don‚Äôt think Gordon being out makes much of a difference.

@NaismithLives Where‚Äôs Playoff P in all of this? At least Jackson played Luka. Jackson was on him the last few possessions if I recall correctly.
@Vasu I woke my 1 year old ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
@NBAonTNT They‚Äôre just gonna keep putting Reggie Jackson on him, I guess?
@NoahCoslov @NaismithLives I think I‚Äôve listened to every interview episode while doing yard work. The Eddie Johnson and Marc Jackson ones were my favorite. Incredible stories.
@WBVRich The state charges a dolla twenty five, bishop.
So in OT, do the Pens start with a runner on second still?
@ByzeRadio @BootlegKev @AndreasHale That beat is so terrible
Out where the river broke  The blood wood and the desert oak  Holden wrecks and boiling diesels  Steam in forty five degrees
@WBVRich Very Tim and Eric-y

@GWaffle19 @joeybagovdonuts All I can think of now is John Fogerty. Thanks for that.
@GWaffle19 @tjscan33 Rod Woodson?
@TermineRadio You said on the show that Kevin Johnson is fourth among PGs without a title....would you put KJ ahead of Russell Westbrook?
@Magman0153 They‚Äôre still gathering themselves from that Texans-Bills game
Holy crap. #BillsTexans
@chachisays ET on Atari. As a kid it made me doubt myself as a gamer. Turns out it really was terrible for everyone.
@TermineRadio He‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs why he does gadget plays like that.
@OrtizDYST You ever mess with money lines?

@GWaffle19 Keep your damned hands off my black and gold.
@RotoBallerNFL Russell Wilson or Jameis Winston?  Stupid bonus league for big TDs.
@JoshHayesFS @RealTalkRaph there was a point during your Darren Waller argument where I felt like a little kid at the dinner table watching his parents fight.
@GWaffle19 https://t.co/222DdnltAV
@AAnianoFantasy dude I need help. In a KR/PR yardage league, 1 pt PPR should I start Tarik Cohen or David Montgomery today.   Going forward, would Cohen have more value than Jamaal Williams or Mike Walton?
@hardwoodherald I heard a chorus of boos creep in at the end of the clip
@WPXITraffic multi vehicle accident just before Campbell‚Äôs Run Road Exit on Parkway West OB.
@GrimmerBrian You‚Äôve been awfully quiet lately.....
@RotoBallerNFL Nice stock photo, bro
@AAnianoFantasy you think Virgil Green or Sean Culkin have any DFS value this weekend vs Miami? Their prices free up beaucoup room.
