So proud of these ladies! https://t.co/dmg5s2hmV3
Facts! Interestingly enough, Dr. Mirkin (who developed the RICE method) back tracked on this in 2015. Studies have proven that ice actually delays recovery....we’ve got to do better by our athletes. https://t.co/fAv7jPY598
Yeah this country and planet are doomed... https://t.co/xI4mHUa0zM

@paige_pence Me neither
@paige_pence Very cool Paige! Thank you for this!
Absolutely love to see it! I’ll admit when I started my job here and had 3 female teams, I wasn’t sure how much they’d buy in and love the weight room (I’m young and naive), but every female athlete I’ve worked with have proven to be the hardest, most competitive athletes here. https://t.co/bnfth97qZh
Jesus👀 https://t.co/4FHf6go6fm
Yeah I’ve got several female athletes who both squat and deadlift well over 200 pounds...no clue where that guy was getting his data from. Gotta love guys with fragile egos! https://t.co/4wjsJFvL13
This would be one the worst national embarrassments in recent memory. https://t.co/rgYqUODoJp
100% agree. You can simultaneously OWN who you are while striving to improve yourself, they don’t have to be mutually exclusive, capitalize on your strengths while continuing to improve your weaknesses. https://t.co/Bfxo4Sxhz1
You can still make the decision to wear a mask. You shouldn’t rely on the government to make decisions for you about your personal health. Soft ass. https://t.co/LeogcSLziV
@paige_pence Neat!
Coach is low key swole though👀 interested to see Auburn this year #WDE https://t.co/ixYo17veFP
@BrandonHerring0 @clh_strength Thanks brother, I’m going to try it out with one of my teams and see how it goes!
@clh_strength @BrandonHerring0 Sounds good, thank you.
@BrandonHerring0 @clh_strength I’m at a school where we do not have iPads for the athletes to use in the weight room, do y’all use this template on their phone or print these sheets out?
FACTS. https://t.co/uJEpnFQBE4
LETS GOOOOOO https://t.co/oZwrl4gfA7
Incredibly excited to watch our belles compete this season! Their drive, focus, and competitiveness are unmatched in the weight room and on the court🔥🔥 https://t.co/MvCHsY6AsM
Y’all seriously didn’t learn the first time around??? https://t.co/v8gsHRsjHj
“Focusing on facts, seeking truth..”😂😂😂 this is hilarious! https://t.co/sisOZGlp3m
Facts bro. So tired of watching Notre Dame absolutely embarrass themselves in the playoffs just because the CFP worships them. https://t.co/AewccgnrGq
Now this is a movement I can get behind https://t.co/ilnx4GNXX1
