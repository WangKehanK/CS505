@MegTheMermaid_ Odd request, but can you send me a pic of what the perfect tea and biscuit combo is?
@Bigaust24 Hey no hate! I do actually like goulash, but how random😂
@Bigaust24 Goulash....wtf💀
@srodrick1315 It’s great! And then at some point you just randomly fall out from it, I swear it’s happened to everyone😂 Not one person have I met says “oh yeah I’m caught up on TWD!”
@cal_pal44 Right😂 It’s the most normal thing ever, I see someone eating, I really do not care like cool....but if it’s me, it’s the end of the world in front of a bunch of people
@cal_pal44 STRAIGHT UP I used to hate carry ins at my old job Getting up to get a plate in front of everyone is literally the most stressful shit to me
@MegTheMermaid_ Whaaaaat nah, they’ll feel a lot better free I can promise you, unless you have back problems then maybe the support is necessary😂
@MegTheMermaid_ Why can’t you?  You do what you want
@Sire_WhiteClaw Simple as that though for real
@claudiarraee Only if you tell me “stfu miss thing” like you did her that one time I just happened to see.....it SENT me💀

I really have a swollen lymph node on the back of my head and I been going around thinking I’ve had a tumor all week...gd I am relieved
@MegTheMermaid_ Everyone’s usually a massive cunt so probably that
@Pizza_Corpse Right though? 😂
Can’t believe we really used to eat icicles hanging from roofs as kids....imagine how much bird shit was probably eaten
@Bigaust24 No
@claudiarraee Yes ma’am👏🏼
@MatYatWhite I love her so. MUCH. I have her on snap even😂❤️❤️❤️
Had a sliver of king cake with Mardi Gras coming up and all, and it tasted nothing like what we had in my French class back in highschool...now I’m disappointed I wasted those calories on that🥴
@DarnellMarissa I watched one interview with him like on Facebook awhile back and idk...just wasn’t a fan😂 I’ve lost track of the apologies at this point, but right?! Just act right, ya know?
@DarnellMarissa Girlllll he’s always been a giant d bag😂😭
It's my #Twitterversary! I have been on Twitter for 10 years, since 2 Feb 2011 (via @twi_age).
@morningwood34 Oh it’s awful right now, moods are at an all time low. I’m so thankful I work in a cool laid back environment though and still get to work through it all...keeps me sane! However, I’m still constantly on my phone connecting with new people everyday, healthy balance lol
@morningwood34 It’s by far my favorite form of non-sexual intimacy with other humans by far! With the right people, it can do wonders for your mental health❤️
@mzjaak Yeah like if you were the one getting asked deep questions, would you be comfortable answering the deep questions? Is what I meant by that haha now you got me all fucked up😂
@mzjaak Ouuu that’s a good one!! I should’ve clarified, I guess in general? But I feel like about yourself would be more prone to making someone uncomfortable but, either way they don’t me either haha in fact the opposite I love that shit
Do deep conversations make you uncomfortable?
The shit I’d say lmfao https://t.co/OYTxeBvWEu
I’ve drank more water this past week than I have in a month before and damn it’s nice
@morningwood34 They’re the WORST. Such a shit excuse for a spice🤢
There’s nothing that’ll ruin your food quicker than the taste a fuckin fennel seed after you bite into it😖
Pissin the night away, pissin the niiiight awayyyy He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a vodka drink  You know you love that banger Tubthumping 😏 @chelcielynnn

Dark, milk, or white...your choice baby https://t.co/NI8vMLkB9s
@mzjaak Wtf!!! 😂😭💀 Fame got to him
@mzjaak SHUT UP😂😭 he did not!!! That’s literally too good to be true
@BaeleeElizabeth You might be the first worker that I’ve heard that loves it!! 😱 now you’ve thrown me a twist because I’ve always heard they treat their employees suuuuper shitty🤔
@mzjaak Omg PLS tell me this is true💀
@MegTheMermaid_ Love to hear it👏🏼
What ever happened to that little yodel boy?
@BaeleeElizabeth A lot of their stuff is for sure!! I don’t ever buy it though lol, I haaaate giving all of my money to Walmart😂
Does the “you have a champagne taste on a beer budget” quote apply if the champagne you drink is actually cheaper than the beer you drink??
@KeshaRose I would keep it, but honestly if you wanna sell it then I’ll gladly buy it😘
My best friend had me curious about chocolate almond milk so I got some...and this shit fucking SLAPS
@morningwood34 Oh for sure!! Even some that seem to have those hardened hateful edges, they’d still go to good lengths in the necessary situations.
@krazykupcake21 I’ve been hateful a couple of times in my life, everyone has, but damn it doesn’t make you feel good ya know? So I truly don’t know why anyone would choose to constantly act like a dick.
I don’t think I’ll ever get over how many hateful ass people there are everywhere you go

@ShelbyBo Holy shit lol that would honestly terrify me!! You’re one of the few, but not the only one that I’ve heard this from today😱
Apparently this is common- does your mouth go numb when you’re drunk?
@claudiarraee I hold my breath and brace it like here we gooooo, today’s the day!

@6packabs__ I feel like we’ve actually had a good wholesome convo about this kinda stuff over some beers at Syds before🤔 maybe not? Girl you know I love a wild woman, I’d thoroughly enjoy it with you!
@6packabs__ I’ve been that way on Facebook too😬 I believe we’re on different terms with our opinions, but very much so on the same terms with our way of life hahaha fuckin love you❤️
@YoungYoungdylan Someone who domestically terrorizes because they believe their freedoms are gonna be taken from them, ends up getting their own freedoms taken from them😂  We need more heartwarming stories like this👏🏼
@6packabs__ LMFAOOO oh I saw you go awf sis😂 Fuck it!!
