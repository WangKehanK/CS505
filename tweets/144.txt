@dmpls3 @CarterRamsFB This is awesome! Remember @CarterRamsFB telling a room full of parents and middle schoolers that it takes every single person doing their part for a program to succeed! Picture says exactly that!
Been on the other end of a few of those throws over the years... always on the money! Great shot @logan_curry9 https://t.co/VSLc7Ceudt

@MikeandMags @ethanoakes05 Big time @ethanoakes05! Proud of you brother!
Dream come true competing at Coolray Field last night. Had my fifth birthday here and hoped that one day I would play on this diamond. Even more special being on the field with my brothers, with the next generation of ballers watching. Counting the days til I play here again. https://t.co/L1IbnIyMOK https://t.co/9BiLsPJ2g3
My boy CB with the walkoff!!!!@BurgamyCarson https://t.co/bpPP9Mup7Q

@GipsonOSU What an awesome pic!!!
Great job by @carterdavies5 &amp; @HarryCainIV . We just came up short around their effort. Made some plays in the field &amp; had some good hits, but would trade them for the W. Hats off to HIS. On to the next - region starts next week! #TrustTheProcess @GeorgiaJackets @PBRGeorgia https://t.co/fly919qfQx https://t.co/oVsrZHPKei

@OFFSPEEDATH @knightsbball12 @TroskyRanch @CoachMongero Makes it hard to find the ball! Hoping you guys thaw out quick and are able to get going!
Saint Francis @knightsbball12 season officially starts tomorrow! Forecast is 33 degrees at game time! As coach @TroskyRanch and coach @CoachMongero say, "That is just the way I like it". Getting my mind right..... READY TO GO! Going to be a great year for the Knights!
@MaTaylor24 Good luck coach! Know you guys are going to have a BIG season!
@GGCAthletics @GGC_Baseball @NAIABall Full sprint, reaction To the deflected ball, change of direction, change of footwork, barehand grab, quick realease and hard throw from the point of the grab. All in less than 4 seconds. Awesome play!!!!

44 is more than the number I wear on my back, it is a reminder of the way I should play the game. Thank you Mr. Aaron for the example you set! "Hank Aaron has been a model of humility, dignity, and quiet competence." - Andrew Young https://t.co/Rfy2Zc4259
@SECbaseball @ribliss2 Plays the game with energy and a smile on his face! Just plays the game the right way. He is one of those guys I try to follow closely and learn from, which is why I'll never forget this play. https://t.co/27VQbEdufh
@VirginiaRecruit Blue Jersey with pinstripe pants üî•... need a Knicker option for us middle guys though!

@davidson_coop @FlatgroundBats Swing is looking good Coop!
@CoachMongero @UNCWBaseball Happy birthday Taber! Tear it up this spring!
@TrevorFlow Big time Coach @trevorflow!
@JRudd_Scout @FlatgroundApp @FlatgroundBats Very cool idea during a very tough year for the '21 seniors!
@KasselMedia You have to see it to believe it! Was there for a camp in November and felt like I was on a college campus.
@ButchBaseball29 I don't really think about height - just work hard and play the game. Since I was little, I have watched and learned from the best - guys like @mookiebetts, @STR0, Pedroia, @ozzie, @camcoursey4, @TaberMongero2 - proof that you play the game the right way, someone will notice.
Thank you coach, means a lot coming from you! Really appreciate @PhilKerberPBR for taking notice of the way I play the game! https://t.co/WUVJtHI8Se
Thank you @PBRGeorgia and @PhilKerberPBR for the writeup. Love this game and ready for the 2021 Season! https://t.co/9jHe7vhBk0

@qualityatbats @TaberMongero2 That is amazing @qualityatbats! Always so much information to learn from you and @DirtBrosInfield! Grateful to all of the coaches out there sharing knowledge right now and giving us players a chance to get better every day!
@ClemsonBaseball Incredible pic! Love that field!
@KSUOwlsBaseball @knightsbball12 Great pitcher, even better teammate! Can't wait to come see him do his thing at KSU!
Played with him this fall and he has all the tools. Takes hits away in the outfield every time he steps foot on the field! His numbers are great, but his game play is incredible! https://t.co/uGAnbmDL6L
@troskybaseball Best camp around for infielders by far, changed the way I play the game! The infield techniques taught are great, but the emphasis on the mental game is the true difference maker. #GMYR
@AuburnBaseball Gotta go with @ribliss2 and the Orange Team!
@CoachJeffLeach Only if it is set for my height
@FlatBillWestTx @DirtBrosInfield @CoachMongero @TroskyRanch @TrevorFlow @nthbaseball Trying to make it an annual thing if I can, always plenty to work on improving. Trosky and Mongero just run an amazing camp! Really tired tonight, but I would be right back out there tomorrow if I could.
Amazing weekend at the @DirtBrosInfield  infield camp working on my craft! Thank you @CoachMongero and @TroskyRanch! Thank you @TrevorFlow  and @nthbaseball for hosting at your awesome facility and for the chance to get some  extra work with your boys! https://t.co/3RGUmrU2cq
