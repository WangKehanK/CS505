@JOLATWEET I agree- I think it will be pretty neutral and won‚Äôt be attacking members of the RF, but commenting on the institution itself.
#ArmieHammer #armie   This is what House of Effie, the Instagram account, put on its story.   This page was responsible for posting all of the alleged DMs between AH and many women.   It is unclear what source this account has to additional information. https://t.co/ecvBueqryW
