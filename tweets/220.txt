@TheJoeLynch @Jamievoorhees6 @Kellimaroney I thought since FH2 is a long lost pipe dream I'd see if you were up for those lil buggers. Now I'm talkin full blown good ole American violence without reason.

@DreadCentral Jason x is better than hell imo. Space had a place. It was late but it had a place. Hell had a place and jumped to a new game from my POV.
@cordisbored Plot twist: we find out it's an artsy fartsy movie about pollution and sad clowns.
@DaveVescio Rick Moranis did walk away from Hollywood when his wife got sick. You got to admire that.

@slothrop420 Could be romantic comedy but I would call it horror for the fact there is an undead Psychopath murdering anyone in his path but hey it just my take. https://t.co/9jOtr6VjOf

@KristinaArntz_ The Good Exorcist by @joshstifter or Psycho Ape by @Addison_Binek it's tough to decide #1.
@VictoriaDeMare @DMX Very sad indeed. I hope he comes back soon. It definitely gets rough sometimes and it can get crazy and overwhelming. I know it can be that way for just about anyone.
