Bling Empire on Netflix is like a million gazillion times better (and less cringe) than KUWTK for all my reality show fans!!!
@hiimlizzy 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 I DONT KNOW IF IM DUMB OR JUST UNINFORMED
what even are 3D printers? When were they invented and why wasn't it made to be as big of a deal as cellphones were??? Are you telling me I can just program a machine to create anything I want or need in real life
Khloe was my favorite kardashian but I really can't stay behind someone who frenzies the internet over one normal photo of her being "leaked" because it's not heavily photoshopped. Like you're perpetuating the problem girl?
if ur Instagram story is unreasonably long u better believe the views don't fuckin matter cause nobody's reading all that shit
@Brokendreams69 there won't be a next time since we're leaving these losers behind in less than 30 days 😉😜 let them be miserable in peace
@hiimlizzy girl if it was me who walked her u KNOW I would've said some slick ass shit like that but unfortunately it was Becky who walked her and she doesn't want the smoke like I do
why do so many neighbors in this ghetto ass neighborhood have a problem with my fuckin dog? Maybe you should like, buy some land of your own instead of renting an apartment if you don't want people walking their dog across your PUBLIC sidewalk???? Stupid bitches
I said I wanted to get another tattoo within the next 2 weeks max and my bf made it happen. Even though his artist has been booked for weeks. Amazing how I've been the luckiest girl in the world for almost 4 years already 😭
YAYYYY FINALLY 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻 https://t.co/09VABrocdM
apartment hunting honestly fucking sucks lol
that verse from imma be by the Black Eyed Peas was definitely running through my head all day every day when it first came out in 2009 and it actually took me a minimum of 3 years to get it out. 9 years I've been clean and it's stuck in there again, CONSTANTLY. Thanks tiktok.
I think I wanna get another tattoo this weekend 🤔
