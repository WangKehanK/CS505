I give y’all permission to ignore me, I’m just going through it and venting
Why am I not allowed to just live the rest of my days out as a hermit living in a cave somewhere, like trying to be friendly and fulfill obligations while sick is such a struggle.
I could honestly cry thinking about how tiring it is that I’m just always sick. Like if it’s not one thing it’s another. *sighhhhhh*
(I don’t drink btw)
I’m awoken out of slumber for no apparent reason and then not even 5 mins after, I’m throwing up; what could be so anxiety inducing it affects my sleep like that? 😪😪😪
Everyone tells me it’s anxiety making me throw up (which I’m not ruling out) but it’s honestly like a hangover the way it happens...
Thankfully i usually get better by the time I go in to work; but I feel like shit all morning and then am so tired by the time I go in. 😩
Day 3 of daily vomiting again. Smh.
Seafood is gross. All of it, even when it’s good it’s gross. https://t.co/aHq5q5CvMv

How anyone can take republicans serious is beyond me? Like I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed... but I can still see through their lies and hypocrisy. They really rely on racism, misogyny, and homophobia huh... like there’s no other reason for their party to exist.

Just finished my first shift, it’s like I never left. Lol (I’m working somewhere I’ve worked before btw)
