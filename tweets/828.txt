meritocracy doesn't exist. not to say working hard doesn't help, but it's not the only factor. the sooner society accepts this, the better we'll be https://t.co/Y4LWE0oCui
Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a helluva show. I love a series when the villains all have a pretty solid point. Not holding back on the violence either.  It's giving me hope that Moon Knight, Daredevil, and some other shows will work on Disney+

This is blowing my mind. I just found out my wife has a ridge and mine is smooth. How is this something I‚Äôm just learning? https://t.co/HbWcobLJkF
@CJHallTC Love all three of those. Ember island Players, The Puppetmaster, and The Crossroads of Destiny are some of my favorites as well. There‚Äôs honestly too many to choose from

i've reached the point of quarantine where i've decided that trying to organize a music festival in Ann Arbor for Art Fair Weekend is a good idea and should pursue organizing it

This is such a weird stat and I‚Äôm not really sure what to make of it. https://t.co/gUv0wcOR3i

maybe we should improve our local transit infrastructure and increase housing so that our city isn't overloaded every rush hour https://t.co/fWAHytrKB3
oh maybe it was the fact that the Las Vega police helped cover up the child pornography mysteriously appearing on his iPad in 2014

@JosephSlowvak We've been looking at a bunch of houses either right off Washtenaw by Dom's or right next to EMU in the Collegewood neighborhood. I love that area
@fleshytimeclock @AaKarenin i believe that lot you're talking about (the Y Lot) is being reserved for an affordable housing high-rise too  https://t.co/kY6ZfMNz3g (unfortunate paywall)

@JosephSlowvak we're looking Ann Arbor but will probably end up in Ypsi. We both work for the University so we're trying to stay as close as possible. Our friends got lucky and bought a ranch off Packard last summer so we're crossing our fingers for the same
@JosephSlowvak i love it here and hopefully never have to leave. the cost of living here for housing is too high so who knows. the younger crowd here seems to be way more left leaning in terms of who is vocal at least so...
@JosephSlowvak weird how exponentially rising housing costs will do that
For those out of the loop here: The Center of the City is a fake park that killed a high-rise that would've given $5million in private money to fund affordable housing Liberty Park literally connects to the lot but it's where homeless and poor people hang out
@pslarson2 I mean just the comments from Hayner and Ramlawi last night weren‚Äôt very covert. Most people aren‚Äôt as tapped into that.
@pslarson2 Well hidden to the outside. I know all too well the political leanings of most of AA. They just try to hide it
Lots of people believe Ann Arbor is a liberal haven of decriminalized drugs and academia but there's lots of racists and assholes hidden in the woodwork. https://t.co/TVyG0YDPf2

Happy to have someone like Councilmember Song in Ann Arbor. The other CMs who refused to support an anti-white supremacy resolution are scum. https://t.co/cOCX71KDTq
