Gom jabbar would be a good band name
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Fuck FedEx. All my homies hate FedEx
@D11963 True 😫 I guess it didn’t feel as expensive when I was getting paid weekly too
Claire Saffitz kitchen tour? More like dear god this serotonin boost is lovely
I miss getting HelloFresh boxes but my fam is not adventurous enough food wise
I hate getting job offers now that I’m out of Huntington for Huntington jobs
@annfraaank This accurately sums up how I’m feelin https://t.co/gLM7jkre7k
@ADevrick @FedEx They should just open a pickup window at the facility it sounds like. Jeeeze
@bread_leg I’m going to fight all of FedEx for the both of us 😤
I could’ve have driven to Illinois yesterday, picked up my package and made it home with enough time to chill, but FedEx sucks and now I gotta wait until tomorrow when it should’ve been here yesterday
@AeroPorn @NYPDHateCrimes @NYPDShea @NYPDChiefOfDept @NYPDDetectives @NYPDPBMS @NYPDMTS @NYPDAsianHCTF @NYPDnews You are simply wrong
You hang me up, unfinished, with the better part of me no longer mine
@Heatherweizen Thanks 💕 sorry to be a bad pal/replier lately. My mind is just in a thousand places constantly it feels like
It’s been a bad day. I’m really over having days like these
@bigjilm420 Cross lanes unfortunately ;(
Anyone doing anything this evening?
Welp. I’m sad
@D11963 I wish they would just tell me they don’t know when my package will be delivered so I don’t have to wait around all day on the estimated date
I hate FedEx rn
I received this so called “vaccine” today and was horribly maimed by the microchipping process. This is one side effect the liberal media won’t tell you about https://t.co/HxA3Fh4KXM
I don’t wanna spoil anything for someone on the tl - all I can say is I never saw us getting here story wise
That was soo intense holy shit
In the mood to do some dabs and try to forget how sad I am but can’t find any dabs ;(
@succmaster420 @_Juniperr I feel this! As much as I like it, I can only have so many high lifes 🥴
@_Juniperr I always forget about pies!! Ty!!
@lukastried A work of art tbh
What are the best places for craft beers in Charleston?
Holy shit I forgot I have an Attack on Titan episode to watch.
@advxo I wonder who’s blood is in/on them!
Life sucks but at least I got my first shot
Holy shit I’m weak #TikTok https://t.co/21T4v1SLvs
@CamoToxic @GMTJO1 Bro who could forget when you gave me a kidney as well! I would’ve died without it
I’ve turned into that person who actually reports ppl I see in replies being fuckin awful
@_Juniperr Idk if you wanna stick with food service but my gm at Chipotle in south ridge said he’s almost desperate for ppl.
Jeep trucks are ugly as fuck, I’d rather walk home than be seen in one
@asiavomitscandy Some third party sellers will straight up order their items from Walmart to be sent to you, but still host the item on Amazon. So they never actually have the stock and order it for you when you put the order in 🤨 it’s weird af but apparently cool with them
Got my microchip appointment for tomorrow! I’m going to ask them to give me a sweet Kano eye at the same time
@usedacidtab Yes! Cute as all get out https://t.co/20NAS2nDIX
@usedacidtab They make mousepads like this too!!
@Kass_1993 Should’ve put the seatbelt on them for extra safety! 😅😂
This tee turned out 🔥@hypland https://t.co/sbEI64oXyX
One of the worst things about Falcon and The Winter Soldier so far is that they think a world without borders is such an awful thing - granted we’re only two eps in so the flag smashers may have some other motives but c’mon y’all
@jmetternichnz Bro calm down
@GentlemanSin https://t.co/0uXeMDktpJ
I’ll never forgive myself
I miss you fucking much
I feel like garbage
I feel like a living stereotype
I will never smile the same way again
Lack of dental care is no fuckin joke. Ppl used to tell me all the time I had great teeth or a great smile and tbh I’m just scared to open my mouth anymore. I feel like a fucking freak every day
Wow fml
