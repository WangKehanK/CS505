@h3h3productions @MorpheBrushes @generalatlantic It’s unbelievable to me that Morphe dropped someone like @MannyMua733 SO QUICK back in 2018 simply because of petty drama between him and JStar, but James sending nude photos to minors is something they have to deliberate on 🤮 FUCK @MorpheBrushes
Sad. They actively want to perpetuate the idea that photoshopped bodies are realistic. This is so detrimental to our impressionable youth. The Kardashians could do such better things with their platform but they never fail to disappoint 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/GolIayOl7J
Once I complete my degrees, I really want to be involved in the psychological research surrounding the pandemic. There are so many avenues to explore. https://t.co/oK5LMEwiLB

@glow_smokey Are you a Ravenclaw? Because I feel like you are. You definitely give off some wicked smart Ravenclaw vibes 💙📚
@h3h3productions Imagine a predator claiming that they engaged in illegal activity with a minor because they were “desperate”? Wait, JC actually said that? This is absurdity. If it was a significantly older man doing this, nobody would accept that excuse. Just bc James is 21 doesn’t mean it’s ok.

Even this gives me the heebie jeebies. I hate the ocean so much 😬 https://t.co/DmKXHYfAkm
This is horrific. For a state I spent a lot of time in during my childhood, I am so ashamed. https://t.co/OA33YBfJKm
@petermonn People who think smoking a cigarette jeopardizes or voids sobriety clearly do not understand the 12 step program and therefore have no credibility in that conversation. Sobriety is not a one size fits all. If you don’t want to smoke cigs on your sober journey, ok. But others can.
@defnoodles She does this for attention, as if it’s not obvious. If gaining attention by being blatantly inconsiderate of a pandemic and putting people’s health in jeopardy is her goal.. her fans REALLY need to question her morality. And if a lack of morality isn’t a deal breaker.. idk.
@h3h3productions Why does everyone and their fucking mother have a podcast now? My god.

@theh3podcast You guys more than deserve the time off. Not only did you work a lot the last 3 days, but it’s content matter that’s very emotionally draining. For your own mental health, it’s good to step away for a bit. Foot soliders aren’t going anywhere, we’ll be right here 😇🦶🏻
@dangelno Serving us LEWKS. JStar’s apology Vogue looks have nothing on you, D’Angelo. 🤩
I love my dog so much 🥺💕
Then call up @SenSanders and take his advice on Medicare For All. Universal health care has never been more important during a global pandemic. Please act on this. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. https://t.co/K6iYdbEarm

My anxiety is so saturated that Telehealth and Zoom appointments make me almost as anxious as in-person. Will the doctor judge my background? Can they hear me okay?? What if my camera freezes on a really unflattering still frame of me?? What if I can’t get the link to work?? 🙃🥺
Whenever I hear the word “stimulus”, I do not think of money or government checks... I think of behavior modification 🤦🏻‍♀️ #psychologystudentprobs
@defnoodles It is unsettling to me that she claims to want to do good things for people and always tries to “make a situation any better”, but yet is entirely complacent with making dangerous and triggering content (body checking). And when she’s been told that it’s hurtful, she doesn’t care
@CharlesNotJoe You can keep your toothpaste flavored cookies, Charles!! ✋🏻
@KendallRaeOnYT Yet somehow I just know that this shit STILL won’t be enough for anything of legality to be done and it definitely still won’t be enough for the thousands and thousands of fans who will continue to support him.
Normal mortals: “I love this song! It reminds me of summertime and being young!”  Me: “I love this song! It reminds me of Legolas Greenleaf and being Woodland Realm royalty!”
@janelle_fields_ Erase Me fucking SLAPS, and the music video is iconic.
While reflecting on conformity in cultures, it is quite interesting to recognize how societies conform when thinking about pathogens or getting sick. Very insightful thoughts for the new era of mask wearing and social distancing! @DavidGMyers https://t.co/VdSRNQg13q
@TeaSpillYT @the_seshpodcast I know you guys talk about doing an episode on family vloggers and I’d love to hear your thoughts on this 🤭
@nailogical You’re the cool kid at the back of the class painting your nails with a whole ass UV lamp and Professor Ben is like 🙄
@SarahETurney Awh, Sarah 🥺 What a heart wrenching yet beautiful thing to experience. You keep her soul alive through your work and justice for victims. Alissa would be so proud of you and I hope you know that ☀️
@nailogical @simplybenlogica Would Ben ever consider being a college professor? For some reason, he gives me teacher vibes. When he talks, I actually listen and am typically intrigued. Professor BEEEEENNN 👨🏻‍🏫
@ProsecutorsPod Hey Brett and Alice! Much love from Boston, MA. I have a case request: Rebecca Zahau. Very tragic and strange case with a trial that I have many questions about and think you could shed light on. https://t.co/FkF2FD20sA

Psychological experiments in the 50’s and 60’s literally had zero chill
@gowithdennis Nothing disappears from the internet forever, James.
I hate it here https://t.co/lg1OPxiSSy
@h3h3productions Regardless of whether he thought he was 18 or not, James needs to stop interacting with fans like this. It’s a STEEP power imbalance and overall inappropriate.
@jaketapper The problem is that there could be a serious deep fake of Biden saying something outrageous, it’ll be confirmed as fake, and Republicans will refuse to believe it and be like “it’s not fake. Wake up!!” 🙄😬
