@boykins32 I feel like at this point every one should be able to do what they want to do if they want to wear a mask cool if they’re afraid to go out they can stay inside. There’s no right or wrong answer to me just my opinion
@boykins32 Then covid happened not even a year after I came here &amp; shut the whole country down which needed to happen at the beginning but after a while it all started to sound like the media was hyping it &amp; also abc was started like they were lying
@boykins32 I could have but I’m pretty out spoken people want places to shut down lots of small/local businesses had to shut down &amp; also the working class lost a lot of money &amp; put them in bad situations. I moved to California with 2 bags of clothes &amp; my car &amp; I was starting to do good

Really jealous of the people who don’t have acid reflex problems this shit is a huge road block in my life
@kswaaag I also get pre work out that tastes good instead of the ones that taste bad &amp; don’t sit right on my stomach
@kswaaag I 6 times a day &amp; I eat after the gym &amp; that’s another reason why I stopped dry scooping it because it would mess with my appetite. Also pre doesn’t work for me anymore since I’ve taken it for so long but I just take it so it give me the motivation to train. With that being said
@kswaaag I used to do that but it started giving me bad stomach aches throughout my work outs so I stopped lol
