Solitary confinement needs to be reclassified as a torture method because that's exactly what it is https://t.co/CjQY5sFdDK
Margaret Thatcher was the first case of "identity politics doesn't do shit for the marginalized but does allow the broken system to flourish under the guise of progress" https://t.co/OTPkqpnwfe
What is someone's "potential" other than the weight of other people's expectations? Bullshit.
Who plays your parents in your biopic? https://t.co/C2w54Dm2TU https://t.co/mQIiaalT5N
@TianaTheFirst And let's be honest, in STEM you have to teach yourself a lot of the curriculum anyway because MANY of the professors are there to do research, not teach. It's all bullshit from top to bottom.
People who talk about adoption as an option never mention the risks of pregnancy and birth, including: - pelvic floor collapse - incontinence - metabolic syndromes - muscle adhesions  And those can persist after pregnancy! Pregnancy itself is hell for some people. https://t.co/i6kb1UR6jz
An acquaintance from college had a whole ass brain aneurysm in her mid-twenties WHAAAAAT THE FUUUUUCK
@Asia_Marie95 Ooooooo where you going?
Why do y'all think uber is about to be profitable for the first time coincidentally at a point when ridesharing has reached critical mass? Cabs are cheaper now in Boston and Chicago in my experience, and they even have apps for requests. https://t.co/bSYLxJ25bZ
And here we find a new villain origin story https://t.co/jI8vL8VTHe
"if you don't sin, Jesus died for nothing" good night twitter!
This is from 2015, but I still feel so bad for him and hope he found someone that loves him, or at least freedom from this https://t.co/1yPYiYlXGl
@ramsey1_ @PallaviGunalan @poorhilarybanks You know that women are people, right?
The most offensive part of being called a catfish is the insinuation that if I decided to go that route, that THIS is what I'd choose. Please, I'm way better than that.
Between the doll head, lack of seasoning, undercooking, and sheer amount of fat I just can't https://t.co/XKqryYalKf
Tbh at this point getting people to see the humanity in others is going to require psychedelics. No one talk to me about humanity until you've either recognized the experiences&amp;emotions of others or at least had MDMA. https://t.co/jWR5cLY82F
@BrotherGram If we evaluated systems based on their best outcomes, then pyramid schemes wouldn't be a scam. There will always be people who do well in broken systems, that doesn't mean the systems aren't broken.
In this light, my full name is absolutely badass.
@BrotherGram "I'm just telling you what I did and selling a course that explains what I did and how it took me 10 hrs a week, and you can do what you want after."  To take a page from your book, I didn't say you were running a scam, I just said it sounds like it. Have fun with your lawyer.
@BrotherGram 10 hrs a week for 4500-6000 a month doesn't imply easy? Why mention that in your marketing then?  You don't have to answer me for me to see what this is.
@BrotherGram Any types of "easy" money + consultation fees basically scream scam. But you can always prove me wrong by answering the questions from the tweet.  https://t.co/AK0NM4qYtK
@BrotherGram Thank you for proving my point by avoiding literally every question that I asked. I'm an expert in identifying scams and scammy language.
Constantly oscillating between "I can actually afford this" and "this is what was meant by lifestyle creep"
@BrotherGram lol. I would never, my success is derived from better than peddling drivel to others for profit. How much of your wealth is from vending machines than "consulting" about them? What are the outcomes of your consults? What good has your "entrepreneurship" generated for the world?
LLC Twitter has evolved. This only works if: - your machines are ALL strategically placed - they're relatively close together (or you're gonna spend a lot of time filling up) - with constant foot traffic year round - you have a LOT of capital to start, machines&amp;snacks ain't cheap https://t.co/hLYcnyThX5
Introduce yourself as your names meaning:  Hello, I am peaceful, holding the power of the trinity and full of wealth. https://t.co/pixIys7IOQ
@nolanisk @JoshuaOgundu I'm TRYING. 2022 tho, byeeee USA
@hawillisdc I thought it would be more subtle and gradual. https://t.co/a6LPIBJ62P https://t.co/7NDj8f0OJl
My profile is the opposite of catfishing. It's a dogmouse profile.
@cada_verous @Shoujomangaweeb @imyagirleva Wtf, no? The whole point of abolishment is to decrease the number of deaths and transition into rehabilitative and community accessible resources for people convicted of crimes. Get your head out of your ass
@IraPollack @thehill @ewarren Yes because this country is still a majority, but the effects do differ! https://t.co/BBORWRNjIh
@that_gai_gai Yeah it's honestly a bit concerning because whereas Fox is often very obvious in their propaganda, CNN/MSNBC just sprinkle it in. I can work with that though.
@huricanramirez @that_gai_gai Thank you for this laugh ðŸ˜‚
My father was about this kids age in 1955. This isn't ancient history, it's modern history. https://t.co/GUe3b3whua
@that_gai_gai They're both headaches but dude has a point.

In the way that her relationship with her blood family is fucked up, Meghan fits rather well into the Royal family
Biology is strong, and I know that because even though I (probably) don't want kids, seeing guys with kids makes me more attracted to them.
@CapitalOne why does your plaid integration suck on all platforms?
The fact that lawyers can pick their juries is pretty fucked up https://t.co/Xp1QBcAqqZ

@TianaTheFirst She actually went to USC with us (but I think graduated before us?)
I just want an Android that fits in my hand with a gen 8 processor that isn't overloaded with bloatware and has a wide angle camera IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR???
SHE WANTS TO TOUCH ME WHOA  SHE WANTS TO LOVE ME WHOA  SHE'LL NEVER LEAVE ME WHOA WHOA OH OH  DON'T TRUST A HOE  NEVER TRUST A HOE  I WON'T TRUST A HOE  WHO WON'T TRUST ME

I love when people write "Mark my words!" By writing them, they are marking the words. I don't have to do anything. It's great.
If the research proving that climate change is causing dicks to shrink doesn't push men into action, nothing will.  https://t.co/hYZ8kPIPnT
I'm still mad that my sixth grade math teacher knew based on my complaints that I was going to get my period but didn't tell me. So rude. https://t.co/l3LdCzVskx
@iJustBeFlexxxin @katiesscarlettt If the hill you want to die on is that "vaccines MAY effect you at a point in time when your immune system is weakening and somehow fighting the disease would be easier" then fine. Science disagrees, but you do you. https://t.co/ItfSZuyP62
@TianaTheFirst Identity politics does nothing, which is the real reason why dems love it. The illusion of progress.
@iJustBeFlexxxin @katiesscarlettt You know that bodies naturally weaken in old age right?
This is why my answer to "can you dance" depends on how you score on the paper bag test. https://t.co/0aOoqyjx3c
As far as names go, I always thought I'd stick to a theme. So far I've liked gems (Ruby, Jade, Sapphire) and spices (Cayenne, Paprika, Canela, Ginger) but I wish that pastas were more acceptable because how cute would Farfelle, Lasagnette, and Gemelli be? ðŸ¥º
Every day I regret the fact that I've chosen to work at all rather than be the arm candy of some french billionaire that's way too old for me but we cheat on each other and I live my life so it's okay
Sometimes I think about the people I know that went into medicine and remind myself that if god exists, it sure aint benevolent https://t.co/JJvfutGKzu
@JoyOfodu I made a video of me dancing to it in middle school but while sitting in a chair because I broke my foot ðŸ¥´
@TianaTheFirst I journaled in the sun and it felt like a real high

Incapable of critical thought is the most generous interpretation, odds are dude is racist but I'll play nice.

@yougo_GLENNcoco Internal systems and ledgers, just like the ones that check your bank account when you make a purchase except exclusive to the store
I decided my dinner before my last date and got to the restaurant only to realize that  1) I had the wrong menu because 2) it was actually a cafe and 3) we were doing coffee and a walk, not dinner https://t.co/VPIL4qmkxQ
@Vccomplice @feenixroze @jordanjjones @Nahjra @penny_hardaway1 @Blactopus @CrappyFumes BMI is also especially bad for people who are tall. It assumes that people don't grow isometrically.
