@olivebrinker Honestly just reskin a WWE game with Kaiju and I'd buy it
@AmazonChique Sadly this means the big Trans Art Heist is postponed, since we won't be able to use our natural invisibility to sneak past the guards.
@Skaetlett That's totally valid. I think everyone hugs the rail for most of their first time on ice. If there's a rink with rentals nearby it might be a good option to try it out (once the situation improves)
@Skaetlett Have you been ice skating before? Ice and inline are p similar. I used to do both a lot as a teen, been debating getting some for my commute, but idk how that will go on city streets
@BimboPolitic Iirc the law only came about because people protested gun open carry with sword open carry, and politicians got the wrong message.  Don't quote me on that tho
Semi regular reminder that The Matrix is cool af.
@Skaetlett UNLIMITED TACOS!!!
@con_moonscape Sizing IS awful. It's helpful to get someone else to take you measurements if you can, but then finding things that fit is a nightmare. Go for seperate pieces where you can, more likely to get things to fit
@con_moonscape 6 foot 4 reporting. If you get a medium length skirt it will likely me mini skirt length on you. Skater skirts are nice
@beackupburner So it anyways! You might like it once you're there
When will they make a leaderboard for melting gender confort? It's the only way I'm ever gonna make it to sgdq
Is this because I'm really trans? Do I wish I had been born a girl? Would I still be genderfluid in that world? I asked myself this 12 hours ago and had good answers, but I guess nothing can ever be solid when its left near gender fluid
Now I'm laying in bed dysphoric about my lack of vagina. As a boy. My body wants to be a trans boy despite being cis boy. Why why why why why just let me sleep.
*rant/vent* Blarg blarg blarg fuck genderfluidity. Had a great day with my body. Perfect pronoun fit, looked in the mirror and appreciated myself. 10/10 day to be a boy.
@TheSecretSubjct Hollow
FINISH THIS TWEET!  Attaching a squirting dildo onto a Super Soaker CPS 2000 and...
@beackupburner I'm not sure if the fact that it's unofficial makes this any better.  Like I can see why a marketing group would create this, but to be the type of person that does this for fun??? Horrifying
@Skaetlett Out of love!
@Princess_LilVA Rock Lee was going to be my guess, but he came out a year later (2000) in the manga.
@Skaetlett Cuuuuuute
@NewGenderWhoDis Omg if I cross my eyes I can see your dick in 3d!
I have an asymmetrical leather jacket. It's not long enough for my arms, but it still makes me feel unstoppable
@CeresClouds Wow, that's nuts
@MiniMellow4 Honestly I appreciate you taking the effort to make my shit post into something that could be made real
Goth fund me
Tldr: I kink off the flow state in games. Fighting games are a d/s scene and help you read body language and can help you understand your partner, or at least use similar skills.
You can probably apply this to other types of games, but I think that fighting games have the right combo of speed, self expression and flow state you need to understand your partner more, and get good at reading desires from unconventional body language
Learning to read what your opponent wants to do from nothing but how they're moving in game and how they've acted before helps a lot to recognize how your partner is feeling in trance, what they want from you etc.
But also, there's a very strong d/s element in 1v1 fighting games. If you're on the offensive, your opponent has to just react to what you're doing. Maybe you've negotiated before the match/scene about what strats are banned, what kind of match is fun for you.
What I'm saying is that I have d/s relationship with Hollow Knight.
Furthermore, a lot of people get into a flow state after a long series of these challenges. Automatically doing the next jump, the next parry, etc. No thoughts, just actions responding to the actions on screen. Basically hypnosis.
Last night I was thinking about difficult sections in video games. Sometimes there's only one move you can make to get through a section, you clearly see what you have to do, no choice but to do exactly what the game wants and how that's a type of domination
Even when if I'm unsure of my current gender it can be good to just have someone else pick what they want me to be. The big exception is that if I think I'm one way, but I'm actually another then hitting the wrong gender can feel super bad. But that's why it's edge play
8) gender play. I know I already said makeup, but this is separate. I'm gender fluid. I love just leaning super hard into whatever gender I'm feeling at the moment and getting maximum validation for it. All the stereotypes, all the expectations, even "real &lt;gender&gt;s do/don't X"
YES THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE ANGLE THE RE6 VAMPIRE IS OFTEN DRAWN AT WHAT OF IT!? I APOLOGIZE FOR NOTHING!!!! GIVE ME MORE SCARY LADIES LONG DOWN AT ME OR GIVE ME DEATH
7) women looking down at me. If a picture is from a particular angle it will be hot. Idk what's in it or what's happening, as long as it's got the angle and the subject is looking at the camera it will be hot, no exceptions.
Ahh I logged off and now there's more! 6) acting totally on instinct/programming. I have more thoughts this last night, but removing all choices, but still having me active is SUPER hot. Make it clear what I need to be doing, but let me do it. Offload all that thinking elsewhere
5) being praised with demeaning language. If you say it like it's a compliment I'll take it as one, no matter how mean, demeaning or humiliating it is. I **love** being showered with praise, and I **love ** being humiliated, so this is really the best of both worlds
4) being dolled up/having my makeup done. I love looking pretty, but I'm way too nervous that I messed up somehow. Having someone else do it eliminates that nervousness AND hits my "being *enhanced* by/for others" REALLY hard
3) that voice a lot of hypnotists drop into when they start doing an induction. You know the one. It's so good!!! Basically don't even have to drop me at that point. Pleasure triggers can also become excessive. You could read a phone book in that voice and I wouldn't care.
2) going off the last one, changing the way I talk so that it's basically a personality swap. Why take away my iq when you can just restrict my vocabulary until I have to talk like a bimbo? Does it matter if I'm enjoying myself if all I can do is beg for more???
1) Being told what to say. Bonus points if it's demeaning or embarrassing. Doesn't matter if it's commanding "tell me what a slut you are" or "whenever I XYZ you say 'Thank you Miss'", I'll melt every time I say it.
Hello I am doing a thing https://t.co/QSoMKW4Nye
@JessicaCyboid Biggest thing I ask for during a scene is "pick one and stick with it"
@Lubchansky @vexwerewolf I'm constantly reminded of the time I went to a horse racing track and tried to understand all the different types of bets you could place.  Spoiler alert: Some rich asshole decades ago thought he was being clever and everyone had to honor him enough that it became "a thing"
I'm not crying, this is actually victory juice. It's coming out of my eyes because I have no much of it https://t.co/mObP9KmSvK

@quatoria There's a Questionable Content about this, I think the winner was "happy birthday grandma"
Do you think Mario makes that YIPPEEEEE sound when he cums?
@HypnoHedonista @SinisterDenial It was a great class!! Thanks for putting it on!
@TheBratSignal @ArryHypnosis Hypnotizing yourself into a maid that loves housework
@oannablue Imagine having it slip off and having all that embarrassment flooding on at once!!
@beackupburner It's for that arcade cabinet you've always wanted but never had a place to put
@nyeogmi Weird way to start a feminization scene, but I guess any convincer is better then no convincer??

@lewdritty Formal party, play party, hair pull
@erasmusNYT The fact that no one has been prosecuted or at least sued for the pivot to video bullshit is honestly infuriating to me
New year, who dis?
