We should be figuring out how to dismantle the system, NOT arguing the legality of a presidential race that will end with either politician fucking us. Y’all are lost.
That’s why I will never understand individuals in the enlightened community caping for ANY politician.
Politicians ALWAYS play both sides of the coin.

@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ By saying that it is bathroom symbolism instead of Freemasonic is saying what it is NOT. All of today and yesterday you have been stating what the photo is NOT. This is just one example from your profile.
@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ One article of evidence is this conversation... I know you’re smarter than this.
@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ Sir, are you malfunctioning?
@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ Stop the gaslighting. I have not mentioned the obvious Kamala symbolism so you can cut it. Like I said, you are contradicting yourself.
@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ You can look through your own tweets, as I have, and point out several instances of you suggesting that certain symbols are NOT of Freemasonry. I’m sure you’re smart enough.
@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ You have mentioned what they “are not” several times by trying to debunk what MANY other users are saying. Ex-Masons have exposed you all. In due time...
@Whitson @IsaiahHoward_ Why are you trying to demystify modes of recognition of it’s supposed to be a secret? 🤨
Wowwww, our lights just went out
I busted my ass on black ice last night 😂
It’s almost disrespectful 💋 https://t.co/BMbXqNrCVb
