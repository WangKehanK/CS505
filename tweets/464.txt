Aries sun, Libra rising, Gemini moon for those that may want to know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
After nearly 25 years of existence, I finally learned my time of birth and know my rising and moon signs. I don't really know if I buy into this stuff, but at least I can finally answer if someone asks
Forgive me for I have sinned. Discovered that you can use DS4 controller as a bluetooth input for android. I am a god compared to all the 9 yo kids playing COD mobile and I'm not going to stop.
