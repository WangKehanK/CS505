@katyhearnFit and @HaydnSchneider really are goals. What more could you ask for than marrying your best friend, traveling the world, making money, crushing your goals/dreams and making cute babies together?
Lifetime by Justin Bieber has me feeling like I want to play it 5 times in a row
It’s time I come clean...I’m addicted to @Target
@iamryanimal, bring me ice cream https://t.co/9kMRCOQLrr
Get yourself a man that runs to the room when you scream and asks where the bug is (No bugs today, just Fabuloso in my eye).
Children under the age of 12 wearing political hats is ridiculous to me
The past few years I’ve felt like every season of The Bachelor/Bachelorette lacks any “real” chemistry in relationships. Maybe I’m wrong or maybe it’s because I have a @iamryanimal and he’s perfect on every level.
@iamryanimal You’ve clearly never had a pretzel bun burger with Mac and Cheese on it
I thoroughly enjoyed my job pre-covid but man it’s exhausting having people yell at you everyday when you ask them to put on a mask. We’ve been doing this for a year!
Need a week long tropical vacation like now
@CaraGirlRoberts I know a guy and his daughter that will deliver to you!
Just a friendly reminder that Girl Scout cookies will be on the market next week. Save your appetites!

A man came in with his wife and another couple tonight and wanted to pay for half of the checks in the restaurant. His first born child passed away on this day years ago and this is what he does to honor him.
@iamryanimal All the time
Wish AZ still had a @Fazolis https://t.co/nL8fgaQoD5
Spending every day with your best friend is so much fun

@iamryanimal = the best human being on the whole planet
Ryan got the new Xbox as his Christmas present and I made the mistake of giving it to him early. Now I hardly see him and we’re about to go over on our internet usage since he’s been streaming so much. Don’t get your boyfriend the new Xbox.
I wonder how many people will get chess boards after watching The Queen’s Gambit
The scene where the guy in The Bachelorette “accidentally” ends up at Chris Harrison’s suite is so planned.
My sister who posts everything on Facebook posted about her engagement on Facebook before she told any family. She literally posts about every meal she eats, every Starbucks cup she gets and every shit she takes on Facebook.
@CaraGirlRoberts You DID the thing!

HOLY SHIT https://t.co/mcj5eKCAdT
Ryan just brought me a bite of gelato while I was in the shower. I think that was his way of asking me to marry him????

@iamryanimal SO PROUD🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
You’d be shocked by the amount of people that think they are above wearing a mask. Be a nice person! https://t.co/iWgZdLpOt8
1 month until my best friend and I get the keys to OUR home! Love doing life with @iamryanimal❤️
Ryan called this 2 hours ago https://t.co/XMfl00Avo8

@iamryanimal I’m crying
