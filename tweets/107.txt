@SBondyNYDN The Knicks, the losingest NBA franchise over the last 2 decades, has spent that time chasing overpriced assets and destroying their cap. They‚Äôre now having their best season in years, accumulating assets+flexibility, and patiently building a team the right way. #fixedthatforyou
@ZaeMcGuire @TheNBACentral Heat lose in the first round last year without Bam. Pretty sure Tatum knows who‚Äôs better https://t.co/wcwFQFp7ji
@TheNBACentral Isn‚Äôt Jamal Murray 24?
@Kazeem Knicks are exactly what happens when a team transitions from losing culture to winning culture. They battle every game but aren‚Äôt great yet at executing down the stretch. Same thing happened to the Sixers in their first good year.
@MyJewishGuilt I‚Äôm submitting this tweet to child protective services
@rjacoby13 That‚Äôs illegal
@rrtfb I am of the opinion that any Center not named Embiid or Jokic isn‚Äôt worth more than $10M a year. Short careers, injury prone, position being phased out, unplayable down stretch.
@spleenjean @livaniza @whyyn0TT @wojespn I'm a Knicks fan. Pretty sure that was a Lakers title. It's a known fact that the biggest losers on the internet are the ones who talk about Lebron on every post, regardless of if he is mentioned.
@whyyn0TT @wojespn Lol dude they already have a ring
@wojespn Nooooooooooo
@OffTheBallPod @nyknicks Wait til the off-season when we don‚Äôt have to give anything up. He‚Äôs an RFA
@shwinnypooh He was supposed to be the NBA ready player with limited upside. That means this could be it
@shwinnypooh you would know, what the hell happened to Obi? Started the year decent, got hurt, and now he‚Äôs garbage
@Happyknicksfan1 @Strugglingknic1 @DailyKnicksFS Unless he learns pick and roll, off ball movement, and defensive rotations, this is his future. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that Sweet Lou is his favorite player
@drewmagary You missed the obvious hindsight for the pandemic (other than Bitcoin): I would have signed up for the first Moderna or Pfizer trial and then been invincible from like May 2020 on.
@blames_dolan @agb3n Everybody watching knows it shoulda been Halliburton
@KnicksNation You spelled playmaker wrong
@sepinwall @MikeVorkunov IQ plays like a 6th man. Until he learns pick and roll, gets that assist rate up, and knows where to be on D and when the ball isn‚Äôt in his hands, he‚Äôll come off the bench. Thibs knows what he‚Äôs doing. Best skill IQ can learn right now is screen setting and P&amp;R coverage.
@ZachRoth Aww sleet sleet sleet sleet
@drewmagary @thelatinochild ‚ÄúI meant to say cuck‚Äù
@shwinnypooh Looking back on this, they did one of these and I‚Äôm happy.
@MyJewishGuilt This would require a camera, so no
@phortin Private service announcement. Figure it out.
@phortin He‚Äôs got better job security than I do
PSA: Knicks have won 7 of their last 9 and are currently #4 in the East
@patriottakes Done. Where do I sign?
@shwinnypooh Depends on how you look at it https://t.co/uXMFW5xqtU
@PeteLikesPhish You should Kondo those. They clearly don‚Äôt spark joy
@IAM_KOTON Would that involve KP‚Äôs Mavs being a lottery team for that #1 pick because I am ALL IN on this scenario
@MyJewishGuilt You‚Äôre already out of touch old man
@MyJewishGuilt Pretty sure we all say it to your face too, but the mind hears what it wants to hear
@MyJewishGuilt https://t.co/Mdtx4zr9yK
@MyJewishGuilt @heyscottyb https://t.co/O3wLJxh8WF
@unclefoolio @blames_dolan What you meant to say was ‚Äúdude shoots 38% and has 5 TOs a game on a lottery team with the NBA‚Äôs leading scorer and defines the term empty stats.‚Äù
@MyJewishGuilt Kids these days can‚Äôt produce true classics that make you think like ‚ÄúPoker Arms‚Äù
@jasonrmcintyre Neither of them played a snap, who cares
@shwinnypooh I keep convincing myself he‚Äôs another Zach Lavine good stats on a bad team kinda guy.
@BigWos @TheAthletic Love how this turned out! That last line killed me
@LindseyGrahamSC You have spent your entire career directly working against his dream
@BenchWarmerPost @shwinnypooh This makes me feel so much better. Giving KP a max would have been an even bigger disaster. IQ, Randle, and two more 1st rounders is a great haul.
@jjolly74 ‚ÄúI never needed you like this before‚Äù is great bumper music
@hurfays @bscobey13 @SportsBallFan01 @cp3sunss Maybe saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy it‚Äù was the wrong way to say something. What I meant to say was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get how that trade went through if he had a potential growth on his kidneys.‚Äù That‚Äôs the part that makes no sense.
@bscobey13 @SportsBallFan01 @cp3sunss I don‚Äôt buy that. If he failed his physical the trade wouldn‚Äôt have gone through.
@BigWos Lakers are a well coached beautiful team to watch. Nets are a mishmash of offensive talent and defensive lapses with a rookie coach. I‚Äôd take at least 3 other east teams before the Nets.
@MyJewishGuilt Yes! NFL Futures! Over/under on wins
@MyJewishGuilt Still likes both more than Eric
@ZachRoth https://t.co/OTnPLqJdYu
@TommyBeer He has the highest percentage of 0-3 foot FGA in the league for a reason. You can‚Äôt be serious with that analysis... https://t.co/I2cN81sg0a
@gregorycampane1 @PatriciaKwasni2 @RepMattGaetz It rises above the category of ‚Äúpolitical opinion‚Äù when it incites violence. You should know that, JD/MBA.
@shwinnypooh Any knicks fan who isn‚Äôt hopeful and optimistic after this start can‚Äôt be happy with anything

@DrewfromJersey 20 years from now, when I think about 2020 my brain will probably tell me COVID was all Gase‚Äôs fault
@MyJewishGuilt The trick is picking the right hill to die on
@FSSOSEQ alright, I got Keenan Allen, Fournette, Bell, AB, or Jeff Wilson Jr. for the flex.
@BigWos They have a lot of cobwebs to shake out, given the injuries and 9 month break. They won‚Äôt play elite teams every night, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they finished anywhere from 5-10th seed.

@AishaAnnHakim Once covid is done I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be leaving the house more, which means I‚Äôll be getting a separate one that connects to my phone.
@AishaAnnHakim I don‚Äôt use one that hooks up to my phone so I can have a dedicated monitor device that‚Äôs always on and I can use my phone to go on Twitter

@MyJewishGuilt ARE YOU NOT INTERNETAINPRENEURED?!? https://t.co/mvNv3s0qQH

@SpliffyKJ @Ian_Barns @riffsn8o8s @RTNBA Harden was up 3-2 on a 73 win Warriors team when CP3 got hurt, using your logic.
@MyJewishGuilt @marcrebillet Also, charities will owe him money now. Win win?
@marcrebillet Ok hear me out. If you‚Äôre a fan, unsubscribe to Marc on YouTube right now and we‚Äôll get a stream that never ends.
@PHISHpointO @phuckchristy I have it on good authority that Seth Green likes Phish.

@PeteLikesPhish Iso OJ Show jacket art
@CopingMAGA Weather channel style slideshow and forecast with pleasant music in the background as the melts roll in
@RimesRutledge It‚Äôs his job to be silly on TV
@RimesRutledge Noticed that. I think he refuses to say his name anymore to deprive him of the one thing he has left: attention.
@fjamesdolan @JeffreyBellone Best case scenario is a mid season promotion
@fjamesdolan @JeffreyBellone Not with a spot on the opening day lineup.
@fjamesdolan @JeffreyBellone This, except for Knox. He‚Äôs on the bench.
@JeffreyBellone I would bet every cent I have that there‚Äôs zero chance this is the starting lineup.
@PeteLikesPhish Lord knows Bonerama is trying
@MyJewishGuilt You look like the messed up hormone monster‚Äôs even more messed up hormone monster.
@ZachRoth This Maserati is making me enjoy driving again!
@ZachRoth #humblebrag
@fjamesdolan @NYK247_4EVER Hearing buzz on Indiana and Atlanta (who has had a hard time selling him on the future). Interesting teams could be Denver, Philly (I don‚Äôt see Ainge doing that), Houston (hard to pull off), Dallas, Portland.
@PeteLikesPhish Ah, the ol self-spatchcock
@fjamesdolan @NYK247_4EVER Not if he‚Äôs doing a sign and trade. If the Celtics are trading him as an expiring it‚Äôs a different story, but he wants to play for a good team that doesn‚Äôt have two all star wings like Boston does.
@fjamesdolan @NYK247_4EVER It was to complete a sign and trade with a contender with fewer wings, like GSW. Proposed trade centered around Wiggins + the #2 for Hayward + another player (Smart was rumored), but only if it was a S&amp;T. Klay‚Äôs injury killer it. GH ain‚Äôt signing and trading to go to the Knicks.
@fjamesdolan @NYK247_4EVER Why would he? No way he gets that money on the open market.
@fjamesdolan @NYK247_4EVER Let‚Äôs find an actual playmaker and facilitator before spending $33M a year on a walking injury that‚Äôs lost several steps.
