@TheCatchFence Its a grapefruit drink that i cant find up here in VA. Ive only found it in NC and south so i stock up if i see it. Kinda a off version of sundrop. Not as sweet but still tasty.

@RetroGamer_Mag Unfortunately.  Ive used the customer service route which got me 214 2 weeks ago. Ill be patient a little longer but i might have to just pause it until things get better worldly
@ClintBowyer I feel Take on Me would have been more appropriate
@RetroGamer_Mag Ive only received issue 214..what is this like..217?  Oh well.
@TheOrangeCone Watching Broken Skull Ranch
@WHSVaubs How many times do we hear...just because its a category one, dont treat it any less" . Because people do. Give them choices of levels and they will always feel indestructible at the lowest level.   But me personally..if i hear boom boom i go inside to my room room.
@WHSVaubs Whats your opinion on this?  I feel like its a bit much. Severe is Severe.  For the general public simple is better but for the weather industry i feel the classifications would be useful.

@WHSVaubs Time to start a gofundme to get you one of those whole room graphics like on the weather channel and I guess wdbj7. If i win the lotto ill give some towards it.
@WHSVaubs I love the old school radar and forecasting graphics. The 90s were the Golden Years for weather.

@TheOrangeCone I stared down Kyle Busch at Martinsville one time. He was being driven   in his golf cart. We made eye contact...it felt good.
@ajslam1999 @RaceFan389 @dustinlong @KevinHarvick @KyleBusch @MartinsvilleSwy Also Kyle and his damn skill didn't even lose a spot. He just spun and kept on heading to the line lol

@roanoketimes I enjoyed the book in school.
@TheCatchFence Reagan
@TheOrangeCone Booty Barker
@TheOrangeCone Whats longer...the last 5 laps at a talladega race or the last 2 minutes of a football game. This is nuts. Something always prolongs this race
@WHSVaubs I love train tracks. This is a great picture
@WHSVaubs Are they upgrading the radar or something to be out of service?
@Moon_Melanie @007 Anyone other then Daniel
@WHSVaubs Just got back from obx. Took a picture of a sun dog? Is this what its call? https://t.co/kMFudsatTJ

@EmilyRoehler Are you more Christmas then Halloween?
@TheCatchFence We looked it up so you dont have too....that his saying?
@EmilyRoehler Barrels....of fun you might say.
@KaijuNewsOutlet Thank you!
@KaijuNewsOutlet Whats the hyper blast box look like? I got biollante and kong Tuesday
@KaijuNewsOutlet Im confused. I thought they were done and lost the license? Didn't know Kong was one of them. This is great
@bobpockrass Testing Impact damage to the car? =)
@stegall97 I had some hopes it would be some crazy unknown action.  But it wasn't.   The most satisfying moment for me was just seeing Kyle have a bad day.
@stegall97 I watched the first stage and then did yard work. Watched the last 10 laps. It was different but everyone got spread out quickly and then it was just follow the leader. Also they did nascar non stop in the middle of the race and not the end. So you lost seeing them race.
@MMoon_WREG3 It might be a tumor...its Portland.  What did you expect  lol
