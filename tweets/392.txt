I really spent my ENTIRE day, working on 2 exams that I didn’t study for. Started at 11am and finished everything at 2:20am. And yes, I cried at least 4 times. :,)
Still trying to understand why it’s so hard for people to flush public toilets
A middle aged man today at work said, “yo shorty, i like your glasses” ew
To my fellow college students, I am conducting a study on determining a relationship between years of education and drinking habits. If you have a few seconds to spare, please fill out my survey! Retweets would also be appreciated :)   https://t.co/kAsoEiXZxa

Professor: “don’t over think it”   THEN OH MY GOD JUST MAKE SENSE THE FIRST TIME JESUS
Went on campus to do my hw in the library and it makes me sad how empty everything is :/ I miss college and sad that it’s also my last year
@nataliezigs BRO I LITERALLY HAD THIS PROBLEM TODAY 😂😂 it was due Thursday for me but I just said fuck it and posted anyway
@mmmmmbongwater @javapeno ... I can only assume who this was lol
@ReRe26621889 I’ve had It,I was extremely sick, and I could name so many people who’ve had it. This post justifies everyone’s behavior and how they should act, but that is never accurate. I agree the media is a huge culprit here and many people are ignorant, but that doesn’t mean it’s staged.
@ReRe26621889 How do you determine what is staged is what isn’t, when you have nothing to compare this pandemic to? Our way of life has changed drastically in the past 5 years. You’re creating a general idea which again spreads more false information. At this point, that’s more dangerous
I would eat the same thing every day, sometimes I would be at 600kal. I was depressed, weak, failing school, and was terrible at my job. My life has changed to much since then. And honestly I would say my boyfriend had such a huge impact and saved me. I am so thankful.
I’ve struggled with my body for many years. I had a terrible eating disorder for almost 2 years, I was miserable. Of course, I still think in numbers and get anxiety from certain foods, but I’ve finally developed a decent relationship with food and I’m so proud of myself
@_kelseygracee @FridayLegendary
I need to learn how to fucking chew pretzels before I swallow them
@JeffreeStar 🤧🤧🤧 https://t.co/Lx7uvPZCpD
Me: “you never laugh at my jokes 😢”  Brandon: “well... then try harder”
@tomatogirl That makes my heart so happy. I’ve been thinking about that a lot and things are coming together that will make it so much easier to see you guys again. Miss you girl ❤️
@tomatogirl I was literally talking about reuniting with you guys to my boyfriend today 🥺

I’m moving to Fort Collins in a few months and I’m super excited don’t get me wrong, but man it’d be nice to have friends who live there
Can we just talk about how I got a shitty/unprofessional tattoo with one of my friends who also decided cut me out of his life a day later lmaooooo
Is it gross that I’ve had and used the same straightener since 6th grade ????
@_kelseygracee @flumemusic If you do custom art and would be willing to make one for me, I would absolutely be down to purchase one
@_kelseygracee @flumemusic Did you make this? I want something like this so bad
Let me tell y’all why my bf is the purest soul ever: he got me a phone phase necklace - which was supposedly the phase of the moon when I lost my mom, Nov 28, 2017. I literally started to tear up. Again, I don’t deserve this man. I love you Brandon ❤️. #moonglow https://t.co/nP6q5y0Cm6

@pulte Please :( Covid has been kicking my butt while being a server. I’m barely on my feet. This would truly be the biggest blessing
@Sagittariusj97 Awe love you pretty lady ❤️
Not to be a grinch or anything but I hate Christmas for good reasons
This is me Twitter drunk and all but I just wanna say that my boyfriend is literally the most pure and precious human on this earth I love him so much and I don’t deserve him
@FridayLegendary Who knows about flume though, hopefully!
@FridayLegendary They’ve been a thing for years bro, they’re older than me. They’ll never stop
@noodlehead_mt I felt that and I totally understand. You could always come back :)
@noodlehead_mt Not feeling Colorado anymore?
@sleepyteabear37 I don’t think it’s necessarily bad. Some treatment options include exposure to traumatic experiences. We tend to bottle our emotions up ans avoid those things troubling us, so feeling those emotions and remembering those memories can help some with closure
@softsweetpeaa Was it ever reported or investigated?
@softsweetpeaa Wait... water boarding actually happened there? I’ve never heard of this and wish I did
@pulte :(
@BWambolt Sure seems like it, I saw the name and I was like hmmmmm interesting
@BWambolt And it’s CJ too...? What??? Lmao
You have my heart https://t.co/Ct5k5PUohr
@ashlee_snively I’m sure there’s a way around it, just more concerned with what I would do for the time being 🥴
@ashlee_snively Idek how to get about it and I plan on moving to foco in august and I can’t afford to start a new lease somewhere else
Shit is super weird and uncomfortable for me rn and I would really like to move into a new house but the ✨lease ✨ says otherwise :)
@level3vegan Welcome back
I WANT A PIXEL WHIP SO BAD

@_MichaelLi_ Bro you gotta stop with the Twitter drama
@ashlee_snively Probably
My BFF is coming to visit me for Halloween 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
@ashlee_snively A legend
Ok but hear me out:   Cats, but in overalls
I’ve dealt with shitty customers before, but NEVER in my serving career was I basically called a SLUT and shamed for wearing my work uniform. Also, my coworker was told he must be part of the LGBT community because he is a libertarian. I was shaking
