the U.S. Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, needs to fired and replaced with someone who will allow a $15 minimum wage through reconciliation, but President Biden is way to soft to do that shit.

@AceThunderStor2 @Amitch_bighead @daallende @JohnSmi06048764 @SocialistBoomer @RealCandaceO @AOC so your saying that we should depend on oil for our main source of energy forever? and never try to find other renewable energy resources? You realize the amount of oil on this earth is limited right? When it done it done, why not try to find solutions sooner rather than later?
