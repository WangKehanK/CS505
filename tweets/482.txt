@EvanDiRe @JakeItOrLeavelt https://t.co/4GA0XMoA50
@HydroNH i agree Dodgers/Angels would be the best but the thought of Yoan Moncada Tim Anderson Jose Abreu swapping in and out with Bryant Baez and Rizzo would be scary. theyd have an elite infield all 162 games
@JakeItOrLeavelt im asking opinions i thought it would be a good discussion coward
@_Vette9 jajajajaja go buy a lottery ticket or sum since thats about all ur allowed to do
@_Vette9 oh hell nah i can deal with your banter but this topic is outta your wheelhouse little boy

@thatgirlgatto @ImRobotsz aight man cmere
@itssjenz spit on me
@ProfessorSoop me neither man i was pulling my hair out for awhile
@ProfessorSoop lmfaoooo bro somewhere in the riot algorithm it just randomly selects players that inevitably get the worst teams of all time for 10-15 games straight
@ProfessorSoop when i fell all the way from 185rr to d1 getting team diffed all day everyday for 5 days i felt the same way, took a break for a weekend reset my mental &amp; now im back

@ProfessorSoop yo.
@RuxyIsReformed i agree i actually called the tsm upset but the other ones are surprising
@_Vette9 i wouldve gotten all of those teams through if i was on the roster
SEN, FaZe, TSM, LG, GenG all didn't make it out of open qual  thats wild
@SenpaiSegs @LordPunkd lmao no shame in yours. ive been playing in tournaments for 15 years
@LordPunkd @SenpaiSegs my college golf piss missle days https://t.co/pCshO7koWY
@Pavan71519938 @KING_BABYBAY BBG, V1, IMT, XSET are all NA teams brotha
@Kj64Man @Cubs whatever helps you sleep at night. you can acknowledge the negatives while also praising the positives and be happy your favorite team came out with a win. not rocket science
@Kj64Man @Cubs thats not being a realist thats being a pessimist. have a good one
@Kj64Man @Cubs a win is a win, every team in baseball has games where they dont get many hits. happens to literally everyone. thats why they're humans not robots. its about taking what you get day by day and trying to win. theres 182 games and the cubs are 2-1 and u still look for the negative
@Kj64Man @Cubs try to have a little positivity in your life man, it‚Äôll help trust me
@PaulTweetz2Much guy literally made the PASS to the jenkins on villanova and the bulls are convinced that makes him the 2nd coming of christ
@PaulTweetz2Much facts im tired of it
@chicagobulls hey chicago bulls. i love you and thank you for trading for vooch but if you wouldnt mind winning a game with him that‚Äôd be just great. thanks!
@earthtobell id play w u on my smurf but its gold 3 :(((

@CARLIEB0T COD became not fun for me about 3 months ago switched to val and havnt looked back
holy hell LMFAO im so glad im not scared to talk to women in public i couldnt imagine https://t.co/qoTgieB5EW
@AHudd_ i mean they havnt come thru in majors so in that sense yes they also just made a roster change and IMT is fucking disgusting so i called that match but the sentinels loss was very surprising
