Imagine putting your hands on someone and then getting offended when they do it back lololol https://t.co/5scym0gAtT
@Taylor_Ross_TRH That’s the problem. No one wants to sit and have a intelligent conversation about why they think the way they do. 99% of problems COULD be eliminated if we would communicate and be open minded.
@KaitMarieox Tbh you make Republicans look bad, once we quit with all this black and white nonsense, we will find peace. Last time I checked this was America and we are all Americans. It’s time to start acting like it. #GeorgeFloyd #americafirst
Minneapolis, please don’t destroy your city. This is what they want. Media wants to see you riot to show how “violent” you really are. Be angry and a upset bc you should be. But don’t harm innocent people. #justiceforfloyd
