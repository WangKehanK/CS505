@DillonChills @Echo_Smash I think he was just expecting to get both hits of the anvil and was expecting a shield break. More so mad at the game in that specific moment
@salometbh Uhhhh 😳
@NGG_Sensei Almost all of them snake eats combos up lol, grenade pull won’t save you from peaches hit stun

WiFi daisy mu chart, thoughts? https://t.co/o4MTUPT32I

@PazdaGT Happy Birthday Tim!! 🥳🥳
2 in 3 Wii fit players are fundamentally impaired.

@RagnaroKLite Happy Birthday reeshauwb 🥳🥳 You used to be so little that I’d hold you in two hands, now look at you. Make sure to get yourself some cake today.
When you think of player growth you don’t really consider top players but holy shit, tea looks like an entirely different player since I last saw him play.
@ItsWebbJP https://t.co/nEtUDwzHPX
@ShiRuBa8th @rahm0ne It does.
@NGG_Sensei It does barely any % and would stale too so it’s not too scary, this mu is probably slight losing for luigi but if someone called it even I wouldn’t break their arm over it.
@NGG_Sensei Hard to do with 1 hand but looks like I just have to wait until you hit the ledge regrab limit and SD or wait until you mess up your timing 😀
@NGG_Sensei I’ll test it myself in like 5 mins but I’m pretty sure a buffered up b is all it takes at that point
@NGG_Sensei He’s snap ledge before the laser hits if he times it right, also I don’t think mythra up b 1 puts into tech situations but I’m unsure. From there he can just go on stage
@NGG_Sensei wait a bit before using up b, not really a bad position

@NGG_Sensei I’m about to have you promote that one vibrator tweet 😈
So a krool player tried to convince me he wins this MU... https://t.co/KQ0oWFbUku
@Echo_Smash Nah I’m sure lower level ryuga cord is no different from qp
Really wish I had more people to play with, turning to qp always hurts 😞
@OG_Don_Padrino Offline is unplayable 😔

@NGG_Sensei Patch was confirmed for tomorrow?
Finally passed my luigi, official daisy main 🤝 https://t.co/pdYIaElol5
@Echo_Smash I didn’t realize the right wasn’t yours 😢  I thought you just made the corrections I had commented.  I’m sorry...
@Echo_Smash This is sexy.
@Echo_Smash Wolf might just be a personal take for me, I find him to be a pretty exploitable character and I’d probably opt to go luigi if I had to play a wolf. the only real threat I feel he has is his bair because luigi doesn’t have the best options to punish/avoid it. Neutrals ok for me.
@Echo_Smash D3 and bowser go to slight win, villy wolf and megaman go to even, swap pac and gunners places and swap samus with zss and I’m pretty much on board with this
@DaWebbPrivate If you want to talk about it lmk
#UnBanNairo
I’ve seen a random improvement spike over the past few days in my daisy. I have no idea why but I couldn’t be happier about it. Let’s go!!! https://t.co/Q0NRVuU2rP
@ItsWebbJP I focus strictly on punishing minecart
Games for an hour?
@blank0X @rahm0ne https://t.co/7rRq0ZbWxV  43:20, It really is super consistent, I always land it once if not multiple times a game even if I’m not playing well (that was a r1 with no warmup so I was playing rough) I’ve got hundreds of clips using turnip train and it’s dummy good.
@NGG_Sensei My respect for you has grown 3 fold
@IrodXD @ItsWebbJP I have no idea what that means but... Off the dome 🤞
@ItsWebbJP Ayo this john’s doing numbers
@That_Dude_Zman Robi#5608
@That_Dude_Zman Sounds good to me 👌
@That_Dude_Zman I’d never forget : ) Lemme know when you’re down!
Games?
@GrandPastorJ Oh dang I didn’t even notice, Happy Birthday Justin 🥳🥳🥳
@Echo_Smash I love life https://t.co/rh0Tqu7bNe
@ejackulations Ggs!
@ejackulations 👍

@ejackulations 👀
@PharaohSSB That’s wild, I’ve heard you talking on your stream once and your Arabic was mad solid for someone whose never really been to Egypt.
@ZMinus13 It’s not bad but I couldn’t have done it without luigi and that kinda makes me sad. Really want to succeed with daisy.
I suck but oh well.  Hopefully I won’t have to rely on luigi in the future and can just ride it out with daisy. Best WiFi performance in a bit though. Got a couple stream matches and mad clips. https://t.co/hjH9LSMcOg
@Echo_Smash Where do I report wrong answers?
@ZiliboSeney The bran is great but kix are just corn flakes in round ball form. The gap isn’t that huge. Also Raisin Bran raisins are kinda hard :c you have to let them soak in the milk to soften but then the cereal gets soggy. Bad cereal design.
@ZiliboSeney That’s a raisin brain opinion
@ZiliboSeney Kix isn’t G tier I swear 😢
@ejackulations If you take it seriously you got it easy Play around though and glens running with it.
@ejackulations Godzilla or King Kong?
@jessssbu I either wrote it down on the spreadsheet wrong or was doing it too slow before, this definitely works, sorry about the misunderstanding and thanks for the feedback! 😁
@jessssbu @FloatingPluto Yeah I’m going to test this again rn, I compiled a lot of characters it works on but I wrote it down as not working on paisy. I’ll find out, maybe I’m doing something wrong.
@FloatingPluto For the clip at 20secs, how did you get bair to zdrop to connect? I labbed out what characters it’s consistent on a while back and could only combo into zdrop off a nair against another paisy.
@SalomePeach I can’t begin to explain how right you were, falcos actually really easy to beat now. I don’t think I had ever even played peach grounded before because I’ve never really had to. Thanks a ton!
@Echo_Smash They don’t know Robi 😔
@legendarykillua Yeah, the latter half of the season could definitely have been better. It’s kind of a shame because the first half is top quality 😔
@legendarykillua Probably not my top 4 but definitely ones that are special to me. https://t.co/HVounHOCOY
@legendarykillua Did you ever get your personal fork?
@ZMinus13 Luigi is literally the exception lol, we’re fortunate to not have to deal with falcos aerials. Glad to have a winning mu on that character. All my other characters would struggle against falco though.
@ZMinus13 Dtilts should never happen, they would need perfect reaction time and to have a frame 1 jab to punish your fair so I guess zss could. But all your other aerials couldn’t possibly be caught.
@ZMinus13 Also what are you buffering with luigi? There’s nothing with that character I really buffer other than cyclone.
@ZMinus13 Same goes for shield drop, it takes longer to drop a shield on WiFi man, that’s why it’s so hard to punish falcos aerials, you can’t buffer the shield drop or you’ll be poked.
@ZMinus13 All of your other aerials are safer than your fair. That means you will literally never be jabbed or dtilted for landing on a shield with an aerial unless you outright didn’t hit them lol.
@ZMinus13 Falcos nair oos is frame 3 (6 if you count jump). That’s a really good oos and it leads to combos. Falcos FH is the biggest iirc so I wouldn’t say it’s a bad option but since Luigi’s jump is also really high it’s probably just not the best choice in that specific mu. Plats help.
@ZMinus13 Also like I said there is no guarantee punish if you choose the proper move, if they expect you to land on them with an aerial and they preemptively shield that’s where you tomahawk grab or empty land, it’s all conditioning because if they don’t shield they’ll eat a cutscene.
@ZMinus13 No, jabs and dtilts will never work at all if you make the right choice, if you were to land on someone’s shield with a fair regardless of position the landing hitbox will always be -10 on shield. That gives you enough time to safely put up shield or jump if you wanted to.
@ZMinus13 Either way I’m not saying that’s the optimal choice, I’m just saying it’s a real WiFi strat to take advantage of things in that manner.
@ZMinus13 Reverse up tilt would poke a lot of characters shields, especially if it isn’t full
@ZMinus13 You can’t jab or dtilt oos falcos aerials safely, it takes 11 frames to drop a shield and then some to get a move out. And though lots of characters have these options, it’s up to you to understand which ones they’re unlikely to choose or which ones wouldn’t be able to punish you
@ZMinus13 From there an up tilt would likely poke the top of his shield and he’d start getting combod. And he couldn’t have done a thing about it other than try to roll away after the fair. But ty it’s just a neutral reset so it safe enough in my book. Falcos other aerials are safer anyway
@ZMinus13 So that means you can only do an aerial oos, upsmash, or up b to hit falco for a punish. But not all characters will have an option to cover that. Random example but lucario for would probably have no way of hitting falco after getting faired on shield of falco crosses up. 2/3
@ZMinus13 I mean, that really depends on how safe you’re looking for. His worst aerial is fair being -10 but you can’t punish that with a shield drop attack. You’d have to grab but even the fastest grabs (f6) would go even with fair because of the extra delay when your shield gets hit  1/?
@ZMinus13 ??? His aerials are fine on shield, just use the ones that the character you’re fighting can’t punish properly by crossing up or timing your aerials better to shield poke, pokes for free if you wait a bit. The way he can mash combines with his camping tools, he’s WiFi incarnate.
@SalomePeach Pretty sure you could just buffer a sh throw in these situations, I don’t think you’d need to do it manually unless DI becomes an issue
@legendarykillua Looks like im saving the toon links haha... https://t.co/W1AVZoFVpc
@fullmetal_comic @legendarykillua I’m sorry man 😔  I’ll try to succeed where you failed, you can rest assured, I’ll carry the flag
@SolSSBU 💪🏽
@legendarykillua It’s a looooong story, maybe we can talk about it in dms? 😗
@legendarykillua @fullmetal_comic heyy lol
@SalomePeach Looks like I have to practice a lot more.
@SalomePeach Falco can just sh reflector to get around turnip usage and his nair, fair, and uptilt all shield poke really easily, the only saving grace in that mu seems to be his poor recovery and so I end up over commiting to my edge guards. I dunno it just feels rough...
I’m probably doing something wrong but until I figure it out I’ll stay losing to random falco players.
@SalomePeach I just feel like he anti airs us so well, I can’t use turnips because his reflector is frame one and it reflects on the way back, and he pressure me to approach with laser. But we can hardly oos him because his main aerials are safe. I have no issue with the other 3 character tho
Maybe it’s because I still suck, but it feels like the only mu that’s losing for paisy is falco. That character really feels like he has an answer to everything against them.
@ItsWebbJP 🥸
