Don’t tell me you found someone else to creep on my Twitter because I blocked your other boys from doing so 😎 I see you
Me to me: I should probably be productive  My mind on repeat: “Bongo la, bongo cha cha cha”
@waddupitsabs I love you 💕
@waddupitsabs It’s okay not to be okay babe 🖤 always here

It’s supposed to be 71° Saturday and I have another date with this guy, is it too early for sundress season 😏
Busted ass at work on a shift I didn’t know, then my boss pulls me off at lunch time to help the cook and I have MISSED working in a kitchen 🥺🤩
“I’m sorry but your head looked like the tip of a penis for a second I love you tho” okay fuck u 2 Jenni
@jennixo_jenni HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH, it definitely cheered you up though 😘
WOWOWOWOWOWOWIWOW I really fucking like this guy https://t.co/rjaImbSNAW
I hate myself for falling for another guy after I said I wouldn’t lol
Went out for breakfast, went to the height of land, and he gave me a preroll for after work 🥺 My heart
@Harleymarie15 Love you 💕
I just got asked out on a date 🥺🥺
@SammCrockett HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH I love YOU
To the woman in Canton who decided to get up on my ass as I was doing 55 in a 45, I hope you enjoyed me flashing you. I just thought since you were riding my ass so hard maybe you’d wanna suck a tit too 🥰🤪
@jennixo_jenni Spin the fucking bottle
That’s always nice 🙃
@KelsiexNicole11 DO IT! I was so freaking scared to get on a plane, especially alone, and I swear I’ll hop on a plane in .2 seconds now. Don’t let anyone tell you turbulence is scary, just shut your eyes and pretend you’re driving 108. Really though, book a flight. You won’t regret it
I love working evening shifts because I can sleep in, do laundry, clean, shower AND do my makeup and not feel rushed.
Wide awake because my damn cat wouldn’t stop bringing me his toy 😂 when tf did you learn this?!
I’m so used to just smoking anywhere I forgot I was just hitting my pen at the Burger King window 🤣
Lol I really just want to run away
Do you ever want to go up to stupid people and just be like?:   Because same https://t.co/4yDrXBtd8e
“My family still talks about you” OF COURSE THEY DO. They loved me, something you never did. I was WAYYYYY out of your league anyway bubba 🖕🏻😂🖕🏻
I just really wish you’d leave me alone and get the thought of us ever being together again out of your head. This is so fucking exhausting and I’m over this.
I’m truly, truly over this. There is only one way away to get away from you.
What is up with misfit market and pushing back their delivery dates?! 3rd week in a row where I don’t receive my Saturday delivery until Wednesday. 🙃
My feet are killing me but god damn does it feel fucking good to be working for the money I make instead of being paid to watch Netflix.
*On FaceTime with my dad and the house phone rings*  Dad: who’s that? *points phone to tv for caller id*  Me: Um, that’s your wife. The woman I call mom?  Dad: OH SHIT, fuck. *Jumps up out of bed* 😂    It’s clear where my stupidity came from
L O FUCKING L https://t.co/8Csf5EDus0
IM SO FUCKING HAPPY 😭😭😭😭
@Harleymarie15 I’ll message you in a little bit 💕
Holy fuck I’m so nervous for this
11 o’clock needs to come sooner 🥺
@stoneysun97 Thank you so much 🥺
@Harleymarie15 Thank you 💕
@_DJLOW Thank you so much ✨💕
I’m going to fucking CRY if this works out 🥺
Did I need a lazy Susan? No. Did I get it because it had a freaking monstera on it? Yeah, yeah I freaking did. 😅
My nana goes into the dressing room to try a pair of pants on, comes back out and goes “I don’t know why but I’ve lost all of the weight in my legs, but I couldn’t get it up over my rump.” My mother and I both go simultaneously “you’ve got cake gram” and she laughed SO hard😂💕
People on Facebook market place really be like “Biden didn’t give me enough, let me see if I can get someone to buy this window for $450 obo”
I’m outside enjoying the weather and I cannot get my dog off my mind. He’d be sitting right here next to me snoozing away in the sunshine. 🥺
Tis the season to turn off the heat for the day and open up all of the windows 🤩
HAHAHAHAH and there ya have it
@Babsndabs https://t.co/VGq7WD4i94
Yooooooo, I really might be moving 🤩 still up in the air but damn I’m counting on this.
OH MY GOD OH. MY. GOD. https://t.co/n8vvWmcUNB
I switched my shampoo and WOW wtf have I been using?!
@Babsndabs https://t.co/vg0WvyPbsj
Fucking MOOD today https://t.co/y9UHvR6ehO
Holy fucking shit I see how today is going to go
Y E S 👏🏻 https://t.co/ghezPXZTiL
Genuinely curious as to what the hell people do for fun in this state. If you don’t own a snowmobile, a four wheeler, or know how to fish— Maine basically hands you a beer and tells you go to find something bc “that’s all I got”
@NoyesEmilie It’s a completely different world down there! I’m so happy for you 💕
Drunk Jenni will always have a special place in my heart 🥺
I just ate 2 tacos and I can’t breathe
LOL I really hate people.
ahahah I’m literally looking into leaving Maine in October 🤪
@Harleymarie15 FEEL THAT
I want to lose weight but then also mac and cheese exists sooo
Jesus Christ today is fucking awful
Oh my god I tried the Charli from Dunkin and it’s SO FREAKING DELICIOUS! 🤤
@CodyDolloff @XxKenziiexX I will literally take a hurricane, bitten by a poisonous snake, and walking down the street with an alligator over Maine’s winter any fucking day
I can’t believe it’s fucking snowing. Remind me why I came back to Maine.
Okay now my countdown begins until Jenni’s home t minus 29 days 😩🥺
WOW KAT WOW
“Hey when I come back down do you wanna have a thr— I mean get an apartment together?” 😂😂😂
I go back to Maine today https://t.co/vrpBTogxzf
YESSSSSSSSSS https://t.co/tlDWOZcNyT
@Wendizzle3 The fucking sweetest. ✨🖕🏻He’s just adorable🖕🏻✨
@JordanCWDavis I’m SO excited for this! I cannot wait for the album ✨💕
Trying to soak up as much of this 80° weather before I have to go back to Maine tomorrow night and endure 30° weather again https://t.co/RC27oflBJb
