#aot139 i love my girl. I be feeling the same way
My favorite memory of Prince Philip is Friday March 9th 2021 https://t.co/yWbWwNvfcf
Calling AOT Code Geass??? Calling Eren ‚ÄúLelouch‚Äù? Bro did you guys even watch Code Geass lol? They are nothing alike
#aot139 I got a ton to say. And trust me, I‚Äôll get to it. But I‚Äôll just say this, I loved it. Genuinely loved the ending. Do I think certain aspects could have been expanded on? Yes. But overall, thats just me nitpicking. Ending was great
And if you happen to forget abt me for like 2 yrs, its all good. I love when that happens
ATTENTION AOT FANS MUTE ME!!  Tonight I‚Äôll be reading and spoiling the absolute FUCK out of AOT. Please mute me!! No mercy shall be shown. Mute me
Horrible. She tryna be president or something? https://t.co/KkDAlrCERY
Also I‚Äôm in full support of getting money however you can. Just shut up while doing it and try doing it without shitting on other pple and their jobs
8 months later, they a nurse now. 2 yrs later you‚Äôll never see the pple they were posting every day on their IG anymore. Its almost like its a pyramid scheme
Pple be so happy those first few months of trading Forex type shit. Motivational speeches every morning. A post abt how much was made every day. Then its just quiet all of a sudden
You come to my house and it‚Äôs Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Max and Crunchyroll on deck like cmon....MoneyBag Dylan does not fuck around, you got options
@notreezy Hmph it was on april 1st but we gucci bro as long as u knew I‚Äôm an april aries its all good
@SweatyTesties Imagine being a 50 yr old loser obsessed with Driftor. Its almost like you have a crush on him
@notreezy Happy birthday king!!!!
I‚Äôm like a cicada the way I pop out
When it comes to politicians and the powerful rich, you‚Äôre a pedophile until proven not
@notreezy And i just want to say, this is one of those things where I didnt want to be right. Tons of young pple love her and respect her. This is a slap in the face to them
@notreezy Truly a shame that AOC and other democrat ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù only exist to pacify more ‚Äúradical‚Äù ideas. They attract that ‚Äúnot quite liberal but not quite communist‚Äù crowd and slowly ease them into accepting the status quo and bringing them back to the center
@brittanykr03 This shit is grossss
I just be walking around One Piece fans randomly yelling ‚ÄúACEEEE-UUUUU‚Äù
@notreezy lol Ive only had curly fries from ARBYS. And no i didnt voluntarily get Arbys. They used to drop off food at my old job
Yikes. https://t.co/csibara2nq
I don‚Äôt think i ever had good curly fries https://t.co/XvKKQdSz1F
It just gives me pedo vibes idk its kinda weird to me
I feel like maybe there should be some type of conversation when it comes to pple creating an OnlyFans the moment they turn 18 and the pple subbing to them are mostly grown ass men that found them hot before they were even legal
Too many relationship therapists in the comments holy shit lol https://t.co/u4DUlOkpKI
@_Comic_Crusader ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥ü•≥ thank you king!!!!! Appreciate it
@ngozios Yeah i just be there like ‚Äúehh cool i guess‚Äù
I know absolute nothing abt these things
Maybe its bc my eyes are dumb, but for me the jump from 720p to 1080p hit way harder than the jump from 1080p to 4k
‚ÄúBAAANG! BAAAAAANG!!! OH WHAT A SHOT FROM CURRY‚Äù - is something I hear in my head every week and I dont even watch basketball or like Steph Curry
‚ÄúThor is going to fly and get kryptonite to beat superman‚Äù ???
Yo oh my god...we need proper DC movies asap because these comments going off bad movie lore is insane. The Justice League is insanely powerful its not even a competition https://t.co/xeU6RbaYos
@ngozios Appreciated dawg!! I try i try ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/unnCIc27PN
@ngozios Smh bro its all good tho lmaooo. You missed absolutely nothing. If anything I‚Äôm just slightly less annoying
@ngozios Soft block? Idk how to do that lol
@ngozios ??? Whats sb lol you unfollowed me??? I been following you forever lol you got a shoutout from dej loaf the other day
Fuck yo i just wanna come on here and tweet abt AOT and drake. The REAL me.
Saweetie could have stood perfectly still and not lifted even a finger in his direction and pple would still defend Quavo. At 26 I‚Äôve seen a ton of scenarios and variations of abuse. There will ALWAYS be a ‚Äúbut‚Äù and someone defending the abuser. Always https://t.co/F2Itv3VGKU
Men are pussy nowadays. Men only got hands for women and elderly pple. When it comes to men vs men its always a knife or gun or car involved. What happened to squaring up!!!???
Quavo isnt paying any of you to be theorizing this hard
Timmy timmy timmy turner he be wishing for a burner https://t.co/llGO6BYdON
I kinda hate not seeing presidential news in my face constantly. The way the media was on Trump‚Äôs ass is the exact way it should be on Biden‚Äôs
They also gotta make that vaccine passport app look aesthetically nice so its a flex. Pple hate missing out on the flexes
Start requiring a vaccine to smash and watch how fast pple gonna get this shit
@_Comic_Crusader @LilNasX Thats why I‚Äôm confused too lmaooo isnt he mocking the guy we supposed to hate?
@UE_UpperEchelon You cant live your life in a safe space echo chamber. Man up
*sigh* maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be so violent a few days before my bday
Lol https://t.co/idz7IMici3
