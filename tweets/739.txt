It’s only a “moral hazard” when it involves giving money to poor people, but you never hear this argument when they advocate for tax cuts for the wealthy https://t.co/f6rz0usNZR
A surprise bidet experience is always welcome
@mlschulenberg Cause I wanted to quote you but I couldn’t
@mlschulenberg I’m closer to being able to get the senior discount on the Denny’s grand slam than I am to learning how to read The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle
@mlschulenberg I’m closer to collecting social security than I am to learning how to crawl
I’m closer to getting AARP letters in the mail than I am to saying “goo goo gah gah” at my 1st birthday party
I’m closer to the age of 30 than I am to 16 holy shit
If I was a pirate I simply would not walk the plank

Getting a lot of complaints that apparently people do both of these. Congrats on outing yourself as the weirdest members of society https://t.co/DXUXXnr4jG
@sarahhminnehan I hadn’t even considered that possible. You’re just extra weird

If you think this way please DM me so we can discuss the wonders of public health and why we should never let ANYTHING “run its course” https://t.co/QCPp7VBZ9c
@Ben_Friedman12 Thank you for your service
48 hours now without power. I have been fully immersed in the story-telling of Rodrick Rules. The way Jeffrey P. Kinney is able to paint a picture of suffering for our protangist against his oppressor is truly awe-inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.
@ReiterAdam That’s why I love you
It has now been 24 hours without electricity. I have read all books humanity has ever written except for one... does anyone have a copy of Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules?
@CellyHardChard Yeah but why
People who salt watermelon deserves to be publicly stoned
@alllybo Who gave you the right
@Jack_Voigt Gotta be smart to keep up with all the twitter fights you get yourself into
@blake_living Happy Father’s Day
It isn’t enough to not be racist and teach your children to not be racist either. You don’t have to be a racist to benefit from a racist system.  Real change comes from forcing those in power to change the systems that have racially divided this country since its inception.
I usually like to stay quiet on social media about how I feel politically, but I think it’s important to support the black men and women that I do know. That being said, this shouldn’t even be a political statement:  Black Lives Matter.
@sarahhminnehan You’re lying to yourself ma’am
I need a beer or seven
@hunterlovan How did you get so many likes on this

You know you’re cool if you have “facts don’t care about your feelings” as your pinned tweet
