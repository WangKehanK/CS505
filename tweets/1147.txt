Whenever someone asks me my big 3 (sun, moon, and rising signs) and I flat out tell them I am a triple Leo, the reactions i get differ. It’s either “yeah sounds about right” or they look at me like I’m a criminal...wasn’t my choice damn.

I’d like to see Mitch McConnell have ONE (1) sip of a gold four loko. If you’re going to fuck over millions of Americans you should be at least be able to also destroy the forsaken golden can without dying.

The term “Toxic Masculinity” actually stemmed from a movement by men for men in the 80s to change what masculinity means in context of gender role, identity, and wellness.
