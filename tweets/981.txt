@Ailing_Bird I remember making the sweet tea at sonic  back in Texas and it was nuts how much sugar we added like daaaayummmmmmmn
Local bakery is good  üëç
@Ailing_Bird I mean its sweet but its not like melt your teeth off sweet. I still don't like it sweetened but it doesnt compare at all to the southern sort
@Ailing_Bird Sweet tea scares me because i always think its gonna be like it is in the south but its not the same in cali lmao

would be great for my workplace to stop promoting grow grow grow and relax their standards for  12 fuckin months of pandemic and isolation
it is hard to feel like I """"""accomplished""""" anything during pandemic but I think that is not the point.  the culture of constant growth and productivity is toxic and unrealistic and i think the pandemic really made that noticeable to me
@potato_crisp ur style is so on point and ur hair looks great as alwaysü•∫
