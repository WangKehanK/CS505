@valentinavoight Omggggggg 🥺
@Jaclynhill Yes
@natlemingus @Jaclynhill I know she failed but I still supported her. Never said I didn’t. I’m not saying it to be an a hole. I’m just saying she should know we support her no matter what.
@Jaclynhill I feel you like you say this every time you come out with something. Like you should know you’re going to sell out quickly. We all support you. It shouldn’t be a shocker
Depressedddd
It’s like I don’t even exist
