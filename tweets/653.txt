@MaroanaLove Things I don't miss: this
@spiritpandasuit Wow leg!!!
@OnionBadgeroo @nrr I think the next biggest thing will not be the hardware but the societal impact that it has and generally taking a retrospective look at the ethics, or lack thereof really. Cars are also beginning to suffer "number go up" but people still stan them the same
@Axikor2 Oh it's Zev
@tuma_banana Hair is a mystery
I can't believe tomorrow is Halloween

Sometimes, each day is a battle. And each day that goes by we win a little more of ourselves back.

@sabarika666 TBH to me, fancy wheels are like shoes. They're expensive and I don't get it, but sometimes they look nice??
@sabarika666 Yesss, those basketweaves are actually made by BBS! Dunno if you know them since they're mostly for German cars but they're known for making a lot of racing wheels
@sabarika666 @Tyger_Artz THAT BAG IS DOPE!!!  omg bmw\ e34  wagooooooon

Loop ramp and get enough of a head start I lose the cops within about 30 seconds like some kind of movie heist bullshit
There are other cops outside but miraculously none of them notice until I reach my car, now a blue miata which is heavily modified, and I grab the dash cam off my hood, jump into the car, start it and chuck it in reverse. Somehow without looking I manage to reverse it up the loop
Yes, he wants a new office chair, and there's a contest in his building for the most arrests to get a new one. I get furious at this fuckin cretin and pretend like I'm looking around to get my distance before I bolt for the front door, at which point I'm now sprinting out the apt
As soon as we get inside the apartment the dream turns into me visiting this massive resale shop with a friend and I start looking around and find some audio equipment. But there's a cop in the store still asking me for the video because he wants to make an arrest to win a chair.
But I can't figure out how to get the video to play back and the cop keeps picking at me with something sharp because he's fucking annoyed, and I'm pissed because he's like stabbing me with a toothpick or something. I give up, say fuck it, we go in and talk to the drunk fursuiter
He pulls off the road into the driveway of someone's apartment and runs inside, still vomiting. I run inside after the dude to see if he's okay. The cops show up moments later because they were tailing us. They seem to think I was involved so I go to show them my dash cam video
Not because he's swerving but because he PROJECTILE VOMITS out of his suit head over the door of his car. He keeps vomiting while driving and it's starting to get on my car. And then after entering a loop ramp he loses control of the car for a moment, clips wall, swerves, hits me
I'm kind of stuck between them and the cops so I speed up to follow them since they're only doing 45 in traffic. Well I get behind one of them and it's a little roadster with a dude in a fursuit driving it. I follow him for about 15 seconds and it's clear he's drunk
Buckle in, the dream I just had was vivid and WILD.  The dream starts with me on my way home from the store or something and I'm just driving down the road when I see 5 or 6 cars clearly set up for drag racing drive past at a brisk pace, right before they take off and cops follow
@RhathaGame Awwe ;v;
@MellowManed Well shit, I hope whatever news you get is something that's easily treatable
@TaxBeast @tinytunaroll dumpster raw meat
@GELD_SL TBH, someone interpreting it as an attention grab and not "hey I want to give my followers a chance at free art" is their problem. You're good ðŸ’™
@TaxBeast a briefcase full of bees
@DrunkenDirewolf PHEW, VERRA, DAMN
