Dear God, dear God, tinkle tinkle hoy
@vixenshelby I'm dead, this is so cute
@SoFongitsRight This is such a fire look 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@nekoromancy I don't dislike anyone but no one has grown on me yet. I'll keep this in mind as I move forward though, thank you!
When does Steins Gate get good? I'm 3 episodes in and it's not catching my attention yet.
@LaydiexSkull We should longboard together and be cool cats 😎
Shipping shit is so fucking expensive. I sent a small 2 lb package to Canada today and it cost almost $50.

Check out this little animation I did yesterday! https://t.co/PDiNLX7M0D
I sent my mom my Parappa animation and she responded adorably https://t.co/FsyyHJuFTk
@kaiser_iscursed I love how the pattern of your cape looks with the rest of the solid outfit. These are so well done in every aspect!
I just remembered there was a cartoon about baby George W Bush and I want to go back to the time I forgot about it
@xXRidaigoXx I have not, thank you for sharing! I'm gonna check this out.
I love anime Parappa the Rapper, he's so adorable.  https://t.co/wJ5OwX29kn

@corybellFGC At least they are memeing for a good cause and not just for the hell of it.
@candy_kaiju Is it the nose ring? It looks so good on you!
I wish I could say that I was happy and things were going ok :')
Since people didn't see the "April Fools" under my last tweet I'm not happy, I'm not doing good and existing is a struggle right now.
@Zerggiee @SweetP_Photog Never 4 get https://t.co/CFiBEC3DVT
@Zerggiee @SweetP_Photog I'll never forget the horror of foundation smearing everywhere from our noses lmao.
The music in it is so cute and stuck in my head https://t.co/3OqRHInKWy
Today I can't stop thinking about this stupid cute DS puzzle game @Kalark got me out of a bargain bin for Christmas one year. https://t.co/MbjlVgAhc3
I need this to work https://t.co/fcAYo7Fqww
I want more Wonder Egg *slams table*  -in a time in a time period that allows the animators healthy working conditions. So I can wait til the summer.
@MidnaAsh Thank you Ash 😭 Also if you have a chance hit me back on the text I sent you yesterday~
@milk_slut_ I'm glad someone does thank you 💗💗💗
This is my favorite part of it https://t.co/gvmR4oQ8nZ
I made a thing https://t.co/hiLGXjO8cY
I thought Wonder Egg Priority was 13 episodes and not 12. I'm sure they'll do a good job on the finale but there's so much stuff to wrap up! I wish there was 2 more!
@8BitLift NUGGET IN THE HOUSE
I'm reading 20th Century Boys and it's so refreshing to read a manga where the main characters are my age.
@fruitsnackers I will keep that in mind. Thank you~
@fruitsnackers Moderna!
I would have never been born  My mom lost 5 kids before me and I was an equally complicated pregnancy. https://t.co/dtpBOpQ0hI
@Kalark Man I've been craving donuts for days why do you do this to me.
So the only side effect I had was some arm soreness last night that was almost unnoticeable when I woke up. Chets arm hurts real bad today though ):
@kyonijimura That Caiman fig is beautiful 😍 I am jealous
If her shade of hair color looked good on my skin I would probably want to cosplay her, but I look like a weird red muddled mess when you start getting into that light orange brown territory.
Kugasaki kicked some serious ass in the last ep of JJK
I'm so scared of needles I almost cried but it wasn't that bad so be strong fellow needle adverse people ;w;b
I got my viccy vaccy today https://t.co/g5XoOe9Y3i
I have actually seen this used around and I am proud of myself. https://t.co/LP8QRMjjWa
Didn't do the numbers it deserved https://t.co/R7uk7XaLZ0
Bringing back some more original anime memes I made in my brain https://t.co/LKoOALmF3i
I'm sure someone has already made this joke but I'mma do it too. 🔊on for max popping.  #WonderEggPriority https://t.co/nWENcv94Uj
@Romanova A beauty 👏👏👏
I will be 32 in 6 months. I have been told I look like I'm in my 20's.  #DontLookYourAgeChallenge https://t.co/GzcY9x2ZcC
@YandereJane @darlingearshop Keeping my piggy eyeballs on these 👀🐽
@spoopiest Thank you 😭💗
@cyb3rfemme You stopped at a good point, they did a really bad hack job of putting a few later bits and ideas from the manga in there but making them so convoluted and unbelievable with no build up....  Man I just wanted to see Goldy Pond animated😭
@GifMonky Season 2 doesn't follow the manga after about 2 or 3 episodes, skips some of the best parts and just butchers the stuff it does keep in.
@cyb3rfemme It's truly disappointing.
@MisterEvenshade Thank you Rob for this gift
@Kalark It would be disappointing if it was just an anime but knowing they took out all the good shit in the manga is infuriating.
@WakuiTsubasa BIG SAME
https://t.co/9Aza9AnPYi
@nyanbifairy IT'S SO FRUSTRATINGGGGGG
https://t.co/EFpz5wJH9z
Interview was ok but I don't know if I want to work there for the salary they're offering lol
@MangoeCOS Thank you 💗💗 I figured it was about time for a change
@bestgirlyazy I'm not ready for it to be worse than last week but I know it's gonna be
