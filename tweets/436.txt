@piercethetea2 tea girl you can’t catch a break
if you try to spin an argument out of a white person saying the hard r and try to compare it to literally anything else... im embarrassed for you.

i’m too young to be getting so overwhelmed by socializing and wanting to be at home to do face masks and take bubble baths.
so you’re telling me i spent my childhood years simping over the jonas brothers when the one i actually should’ve been simping over was frankie jonas

@FisherSabin just the fact that they did this religiously in middle school but not once in high school doesn’t make sense to me 😂
@zimmy_1031 like I said... not everything is 100% effective, but they still decrease the risk of it spreading.
@realbkstennett that’s huntingdon for you

who else remembers being in middle school when you packed your lunch and your drink had to be sealed. then the person on lunch duty initialed the cap before you opened it so they knew it wasn’t alcohol LOL
@Itsyanewboi ❤️❤️❤️
@Jennaherncane “too old to be on this app” 🥴
“maybe covid cases are increasing because masks don’t work”  no! y’all refuse to wear them anyway, so who’s to say they don’t work if a large percentage of county isn’t wearing one? not everything is going to be 100% effective, but i sure as hell want to decrease the risk.
