@Louis_Onofrio @nicklamberti14 Yes
@nicklamberti14 @Louis_Onofrio And he‚Äôs going to miss one game against Seattle that they aren‚Äôt winning anyway?
@nicklamberti14 @Louis_Onofrio Wash got 2 wins left at most and we have the tiebreaker
@Louis_Onofrio You forget we‚Äôre missing the best RB in the league? We also played the second half with Colt McCoy
@Louis_Onofrio We‚Äôre no better? Cmon Louis, Arizona, that fake Cleveland team, and the boys are all possible wins

@LiamSharp0 What round you think it ends in
@SdotBallTalk Either or, get some relevancy back to NY before Mitch, Obi, RJ, Immanuel hit their primes, attract a star for 3 years from now
Only thing I need in life is the Knicks to be good again
@DomDeRosa1 @Louis_Onofrio Stopppp
