daylight savings time means the clock in my den is correct again
@sarahschauer Having ADHD is stumbling across posts like these, relating, then immediately believing you've been faking all symptoms bc you're trying to use ADHD as a crutch for laziness and weakness bc you're just a big fat phony and annoying bc you never let anyone else talk  :') fml
"Yeah, @AdahopAda seems to reply to me almost every time"  "Looks like you made a friend"  "M-Ada Friend"
I'm on a Pantera kick rn and I wish i had more hands to play every instrument at the same time
@AdahopAda @NeebsOfficial It says falafel..... but also no falafel https://t.co/M8FYp3XaX5
@AdahopAda @NeebsOfficial This sounds fish, like they MADE you say this..... say falafel if you're in danger
@AdahopAda If someone feels compelled to "punish" Neebs and the boys because their editor overcame some scary shit and found herself, they don't need to subscribe. They need therapy
@MISFITSWITCH @JonnyEthco @Ask_Spectrum RIGHT! ISPs gotta update their service packages. Nobody has a home phone anymore, why do they insist on bundling unnecessary stuff together?   I just want one of them to offer TRULY unlimited high speed internet for a flat rate and I'll be a lifelong customer.
@CoxHelp We're PC gamers, stream TV, and I'm a musician so unless "unlimited data" no longer comes with an asterisk then there's probably nothin' we can do to soothe my wallet's pain
@JonnyEthco @Ask_Spectrum I've got Cox internet for """"$80""""" but its actually 100GB of data that I burn through almost immediately, and $15 per extra 10GB.   So its more like $120 and I'm pissed
Laws mean nothing anymore. I am fuckin sickened.  I guess this is america now
It's clean sheet day so I set our washer on "sanitize" and added all the scents and softeners and what-have-you.   Bad news is "sanitize" means HOT for a two hour cycle and the navy blue dye ran from the sheets.  Good news is our silver pillow cases now match the bed sheets! ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜‚
@AdahopAda F
They say Americans are desensitized to pretty much everything and I agree.  But the Capitol footage still makes me weep even after seeing it every day for a month.   Convict this fuckin prick. Put him away.  #ImpeachmentTrial #ImpeachmentDay #ImpeachAndConvict

My thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Texas tonight :'(  Nothing happened but @tedcruz is their senator and it's just a god damn shame
@ToughTaters Yes but my brain does the sees-words-but-doesnt-register thing at the same time so i have to go back anyway
@AdahopAda Am i too late to contribute???
Idk how it's still $0.07 a share. The price is so low you're REQUIRED to buy at least 10, and that's less than a BUCK. If you buy in for 10 shares at $0.10 apiece, it's $1. If #dogecoin hits $1 per share, you now have $10.  We just saw proof that this works
@zurzieh i know i realized it the moment i pressed send :'( F
FUCK IM SORRY I MEANT $10, STUPID FAT FINGERS SORRY
Man if Dogecoin hits a dollar I can pay my rent AND keep my lights on. I wouldn't have to choose :') #DogecoinToTheMoon #dogecointoadollar
@pbandgelz You got it girl! Above all, your only obstacle how much shit you're gonna slam dunk to achieve this. You are the future!ðŸ’–
