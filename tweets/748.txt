My 2nd vaccine is at 3 and bottomless at 4. Will she make it? https://t.co/F4yKHBaj6l
Why did my niece just say “booty all out cooking bacon” ?!?!?!?!?!
When they’re giving out Johnson and Johnson vaccines at the mall and everyone is declining the offer....😅

Wow how I send my mom a photo of some nikes I’m excited I bought and she hits me with the ???  Bye.
@briierika 👀
@FannyLeslie13 Girl I’m at work with a fever lmao my mom felt NOTHING 😭
I have the worst fucking headache. Just chop my head off already.
When the vaccine side effects kick in. https://t.co/Pt1Pp60Y7M
Dis too much for a Monday.
Brain: Off
I’m so fucking exhausted.
On a mini trip high, that I booked a trip to Palm Springs while in San Diego 😇 can’t wait for covid to end...so REAL traveling can happen.
Need a (masked) hiking partner tomorrow 🙃
People are literally dying, and the lines and crowds to out-door dine are insane...I assure you, you can make your own avocado toast at home.
I can’t stop thinking about when  a random customer at work asked if I would show him around town and all I said was “I’m good” 🥴 then we awkwardly just looked at each other lmao
This is triggering. *prom night 2010. Head outside car window on drugs* life was good. https://t.co/lXtEagD8iM
All I’m gonna say is, thank god I’m in therapy. I hope those who aren’t because of the stigma know that it’s ok, and you’re not “crazy”, you just need the extra push to really unpack what you’re feeling and thinking already. They help you, heal yourself 🤍 it’s all you boo.
@espookyh0e Lololol it’s like just tell the truth. I already know the truth anyway 😭😂
Friends really  had to remind me im THAT bitch. Goodnight. 😇

Little lies bother me so much more than the big ones. Because if you’re lying about the little shit, you definitely lying about it all.
The years 2020-21 are going to be hefty chapters in history books to come.
Can we impeach the orange oompa loompa already? And throw him in real jail not just social media jail. Thanks.
My biggest pet peeve is hearing people's flip flops...flopping. Like I want to punch the fucking air.
I appreciate having a job, I really do, BUT if 1 in 5 people in LA have Covid, WHY ARE NON-ESSENTIAL RETAIL SHOPS OPEN?
Not HR&amp;Block holding stimmys hostage. While it’s annoying for me, this is detrimental to those who actually need that money NOW. Smh.
Nothing like a lil hood fight to ring in 2021.
A call from me is a privilege. Even a butt dial. Sorry to inform you, but you’ve been blocked since 2017, no one is thinking about you.
If you don’t believe covid is a thing and you’re a no-masker, your moms a hoe.
Y’all remember spinner rims? 🥴
How is every gift under the tree my nieces?!
This is your reminder to not put yourself in debt trying to buy Christmas gifts :)
A bitch is drunk. Why am I like this.
@espookyh0e @addiectionn Love youuu
@addiectionn BROOOOOO lmfao
Im so late to this Among Us shit lmao
Can’t decide what’s weirder being asked on a date by an old friend, or being offended by it.
Waking up and going to work is an Olympic sport. Give me my gold medal.
In need of a month long vacation.
Vulnerability is a scam!
Went for a run this morning after SO LONG and I’m dying.
@addiectionn https://t.co/CMwxSTmpFQ
So happy I’m going to Joshua tree tomorrow night. NEED. THAT. SHIT
Sometimes all you need is the tightest hug from your mom 😇
This month my focus is to protect my energy.
It’s not your bday weekend, unless you drunk text your mom you bought her 3 cans of Lysol 😇
Nothing brings me more joy than knowing Trump supporters are upset.
Trump supporters are scary. https://t.co/9W4N8poyKY
Yo my 4 yr old niece just told me “I wish I had a real gun for myself” bro WHAT? Lmao
Soooo these Trumpie mobs are okay?
All I want for my birthday is for Biden to win. Then I can celebrate.
In the most disrespectful way. https://t.co/nMefNk6C0h
So y’all don’t want to be told to wear masks, but wanna tell women they can’t get abortions? HA.
Oh I’m 10000% judging these Halloween parties. In a PANDEMIC?!
Dropped my Starbucks on my shoes, then stepped on a used condom. How’s your morning going?
I just can’t wrap my head around gays really voting for Trump. Especially those who are POC. Make it make sense.
Why mine look all crazy 🥴 https://t.co/yTKQ2YjeCM
On a scale of 1-10 how bad is The 17th door?! We all bought tickets without really reading what it entailed...BUGS?! SHOCKS?!
The level of annoyed I am right now is off the charts. All I want to do is eat.
@addiectionn Also. https://t.co/Ie6M1zIXat
@addiectionn Lmaoooo. Idk why this shit made me laugh so hard.
Starting to check out.
Nothing like a spotless home!!!
Needed a day like today ❤️
@addiectionn Im DOWN
@addiectionn Girl SAME. Maddie loves them Lmao
It’s hard having anxiety and believing in manifestation. Trying to turn my negative anxious thoughts off because I think I will manifest them. I hate it here.
I think I lost 20 pounds just by walking in the desert heat today 😅
My anxiety got anxiety.
I joked that my coworker would find me dead when she came in so she could go home early hahaha and bitch there was a fucking bee crawling by my hand ready to sting my allergic ass. My thoughts too powerful 😭😂
Pasé lo que pasé no te voy a llamar.
Thank god for my cousin for getting me out the damn house and out of this funk.
Sad girl hour.
