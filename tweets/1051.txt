@nelfears It's definitely disrespectful, for sure. I don't think it's petty. Most people would agree cursing when you're talking to a stranger comes off as jarring and impolite
@R04DK1LL_exe Love this!  !! !!

@calippygian Is she doing a "pop" in the 3rd pic

@eatyourteeth Not last year, sorry *2016. This year feels EVEN worse. "I double dog dare you cast a vote" like am I insane or does this just feel like a game of How Badly and HARD can we disenfranchise voters and make them lose the will to participate?? Because its working and I dont like it.
@eatyourteeth I feel like last year the shadow govt was really like "i dare you to vote. I dare you to choose the lesser of two evils" and I did. I voted clinton despite ... it being Hilary Clinton ... because I was desperate. And she still lost !

@tolraze Bad pic from the snail zone https://t.co/Ik6va7X1zm
Since im not fucking allowd to have a giant land snail at All, I foraged for my own fuckin snails  Just as good  Also free and not invasive
I've been feeding them aloe vera bits and egg shells. Misting every other day
@chokeonthesun I love them and ive gotten two people into them since you showed me love is short
.... having so many of them, and so many of varying size, awaken in my left palm was very cute and made gathering snails for 15 minutes worth it. : )   I love snails so much.
Originally I was like oh I'll just collect all of these lil dudes and see which ones are actually alive and just move the spent shells to a certain plant, where I have been collecting them, but literally all of them were alive. I have missed holding snails
Did I tweet about my snails yet  I was cleaning a pile of detritus in my garden and found like 30 snails, decided to keep 7 of them. The rest went free of course.

@R04DK1LL_exe Maybe one of those... rainbow scale snakes  ?? The pitch black ones that are sorta iridescent?  And maybe get that dog some tats ?
@R04DK1LL_exe @KAIJUUFUCKER So say I wanted a xolo snake dog ...... how much would that run me.....
@eatyourteeth Where did they go ?
Reminder that completely understanding a persons wishes is not a prerequisite to respecting them : )
Mindless Titty Indulgence
@R04DK1LL_exe @KAIJUUFUCKER I will pay you to draw a cool snake dog for me  This is so dope
@R04DK1LL_exe @eatyourteeth Damn what a god. This is beautiful
