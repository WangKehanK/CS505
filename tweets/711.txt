@_notthatCaleb and mayo instead of butter
period https://t.co/IAyWo92jP9
also, i realize that i was this person in 2019/20 and i want all of my followers to know that i've changed. dating an a$$hole changes someone
@bri_montgomery_ @elonmusk is it ironic that i already saw this?
it's that time of year at the Christian college where everyone starts dating because they're bored and then they post about each other 18 times a day
@TSullivan_49 yeah same. i was about to walk out
@TSullivan_49 lol i was really hoping to get a nap
wow who is she??? https://t.co/c3CrH8U4cy
@hgk_avanaugh i reminded you twice hahahah
are you ever just so happy that you can’t go to sleep? bc same
@hgk_avanaugh what happened???????
showing up late to class &lt; showing up late to class with iced coffee
i swear i'm over these ✨children✨that i go to school with
@kterinnn because apparently “patriotism” is a ticket straight to heaven according southern baptists 🙄🙄
@hgk_avanaugh get out of here
honestly, when people subtweet me, my self-esteem gets a little better:)
@hgk_avanaugh period
It’s just now dawning on me how hilarious it is that someone with the word “comedian” in their bio tried to argue with me about science and is still hung up on it
@mattcleve434 lol that’s all i ask 🥰🥰
@mattcleve434 i'm just trying to prove the point that your original tweet included everyone and that's pretty much impossible to group every human into one category. anecdotal evidence is still part of the statistic even if it doesn't affect your conceited self
honestly just really tired of straight white toxic men
@mattcleve434 except for someone i know who has PCOS and worked out while dieting and still gained weight. just because you lost a few pounds doesn’t mean you’re dr. Oz bby 😂
@mattcleve434 if you want to think you know more than science then go ahead https://t.co/8Op2kgI84Q
@trevbvn DO IT omg i have 7 piercings now and i love them all

i'm just tryna go party in Auburn again
@hgk_avanaugh eh not if it’s broken because it’s toxic
@tiffanyjaikens shut your mouth i talk about them all the time
biggest pet peeve: when someone complains about their life and then doesn’t actually do anything to change it
@cothespacecadet THIS OMG THIS IS IT
are ya'll ever in class and just want to lay on the floor?
i diagnose myself with something new every day. today, i’m lactose intolerant.
i just booked my little sisters first piercing appointment and she is so excited to finally get her ears pierced at the ripe old age of 7
@trey_northcutt HAHAHHAHAH i’m more subtweeting my fav Christian tik tok influencer :)))
i just can’t take someone who wears a fitbit seriously
only seven weeks until graduation.. guess i need to get my life together🙃

@__LAjay818 ugh

why does every person in Mobile forget how to drive when a rain drop hits their windshield????????????
@TSullivan_49 i’m glad i’m not the only one on twitter during class
hey. twitter isn’t your diary❤️

@morgantaylor_d don't worry, i commented on the video from my fake tiktok because she blocked my other one *chef's kiss*

@tiffanyjaikens public records from SGA do show that you also voted to dismantle the group. the vote passed 3-0
i want another tattoo
@trey_northcutt i don't agree with everything that was said and i have talked to him about it however, i don't agree with the school (especially student life) treating us as if we are less than human and not even close to being adults. everyone should wear a mask but the hypocrisy is unreal
if you are going to take all of our seating in the quiet places to study on campus because you are "loving us" then please make the obnoxious sophomores be quiet in the only places that commuters can study
@TSullivan_49 oop tea
