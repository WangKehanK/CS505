@CovetFashion What happened to the makeup, A Night Out I think it was called! Dark red lip, dark smoky eye! It was there yesterday &amp; now it's gone! It was 1 of my favorites &amp; I'm very upset!!!!
@PotterWorldUK I know Snape went through a lot but it still doesn't excuse how he treated Harry &amp; his friends &amp; the way he degraded &amp; humiliated him on a daily basis. Harry is way to forgiving in my eyes. Snape didn't deserve it.
@SaundersCantona @PotterWorldUK Seriously! I love how he has such a big heart &amp; is so forgiving but Snape made life hell for Harry &amp; he definitely didn't deserve to have Harry's son named after him in any way.
@khloekardashian That's so cool that u guys have been friends for so long! Even when u got so famous u still stayed best friends, I think that's so cool &amp; real, true friendship! Good friends r hard to find in life &amp; am glad u have!

@midmaddo Hi, just read your article on Twilight, just wanted to say u might want to get your facts straight BEFORE u write, it makes u look really bad. U got so much wrong I can't believe you've even read the books or seen the movies it was that bad!
@TheTab Hi, I just read an article that Maddy Mussen wrote a year ago on Twilight &amp; how bad it was. Of course she has a right to her opinion, I just thought she might want to get her facts straight first. It was like she never even read the books. So many facts wrong it was crazy

@DesHartsock @Clare_Crawley I'm so happy for her too! They sure kept us on the edge of our seats till the last second to find out if he was gonna propose! I'm so glad she got her happy ending &amp; still happy my FAVORITE bachelorette is happily married still! (YOU!)
@MichellesRedux @HPotterUniverse I know!!! I hate her so bad there are no words!!!
@HPotterUniverse I think #1 &amp; #3! I love when he &amp; Ron become friends on the train &amp; Ron teaches him about all the fun snacks &amp; when Harry, Hermione, &amp; Ron defeat the troll! &amp; I love when he finds Serius in #3!
@thatbrunette0 @Cinephile1994 @PotterWorldUK Wow that's messed up considering how good a friend Dobby was to Harry &amp; how he DIED saving their lives!!!! What a disgusting thing to say!
@PotterWorldUK True that!
Had to share this @WeHeartIt https://t.co/nAiR7KyMn7 via @weheartit
@wizardingworld I love this moment in the film &amp; oh I just can't decide! Hermione has so many wonderful moments, like S.P.E.W! but my favorite trait about her is her loyalty like when she skipped skiing with her parents at Christmas to be there for Harry in #5! https://t.co/8wA8jcDHrc

@JamesCh15007432 Judging people &amp; being hateful &amp; mean is not Christlike either!!! You judgmental, meanie, butt head!!!!
@JamesCh15007432 As hateful &amp; pathetic as u is actually married (in which case I feel very bad for your spouse) &amp; not worry about what others are doing!!! If people like you that give Christians a bad name!
@JamesCh15007432 Wow your pathetic!!!!! Christ also says, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. " So why don't you worry about your own life and your own marriage if someone
@ABCNetwork @Clare_Crawley So excited! Can't wait to watch it! U deserve the best &amp; I hope u find it! Fuck Juan Pablo! He is such a douchebag!!!!
I discovered my Patronus is a White Swan. Find yours with @wizardingworld https://t.co/8cT7c0yb0X #ExpectoPatronum
@TweetThisBabe @sharleenjoynt @kellytravisty @AndiDorfman He was a total jerk!!!! I think it's worse that u guys, as women think it's ok for him treating them so badly. He is a douchebag &amp; as far as insults or what they could have said or done to make fun of him, this was extremely tame. &amp; You're lame btw
@SupermomOf3_ @netflix Thank u Netflix for Sister, Sister!!! One of my all-time favorites!!! Yay Netflix!!!
@netflix I AM SO EXCITED!!!! I CANT BELIEVE U GOT SISTER, SISTER!!! WAHOO! Thank u Netflix!!!
@NJSanDy84 @Eugenia_Cooney @JeffreeStar Sadly, I don't think her mom would let her have a job that required her being around &amp; associating with other ppl. I know she's over 18 but her mom has total control over her. That's why she can do You Tube, so she's all alone &amp; under constant watch. So sad!
@TheJuancho @Onision "My own ass hole" OMG, that cracked me up!!!! I literally spit my water out it made me laugh so hard!
@FilippoGiove Still sexy as ever! I hope your heart is still as good as your body cuz u always seem like such a sweetheart!

@CocaCola My party vibe match is #JonahHill. I might take a couple of hours to get out the door, but when I #ShowUp, you know I‚Äôll be #LookingFresh with a hot ‚Äòfit and an ice-cold #CokeEnergy.
@TwatOnision So nothing is wrong with my phone? He really deleted every tweet off his Twitter?

@JoJoesArt @aaroncarter I'm so sorry that this happened to u, I'm not an artist but I write poetry &amp; 1 of my biggest fears sharing my work is that people will steal it. But when someone does that everything they gain from it will be tainted because they didnt do it the right way. Karma is a bitch!
@Onision @OnisionPrime So now the fans that u still have have to pay $10 p/m to see your tweets!!! That's insane!!!
@_CainAmes @saralegging Ok so does Kai not have a Twitter? That's what I was looking for when I saw this comment &amp; decided to ask ya'll
