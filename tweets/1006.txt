@arkadycosplay one time, after playing da:o exclusively on pc with mods (including, of course, skip the fade) for months i thought "oh i want to make my main warden on console!  it's beena  while" and midway through the origin prologue i remembered the fade and shut my xbox off

@ashes8012 @faerghusfour "SYLVAIN GAUTIER IS A CURIOUS CAT"
@faerghusfour @ashes8012 "sylvain gautier" and "rum tug tugger" also have the same amount of syllables so you can easily make his entire song about sylvain
@faerghusfour @ashes8012 rum tum tugger ofc
"it'll be fun to dye my hair a different color before i go back to work at the beginning of april" https://t.co/0NCbXQV5Pa
@lawfuldragon i'm not sure who either character is, admittedly, but i'm always in support of gold armor!
@JacobHexa the truth.  i remember when they got popular and my closeted lil self was stoked but even then i was like "this feels forced..." also the way the one who isn't a homophobe was treated bc she's bi 😬

@HalleHeichou 💜💜💜
@stripteas13 thank you!!
@doodlegraveyard it is a little darker but i also routinely dyed it black so it was often in a fade from that
@doodlegraveyard yeah i gotta say it's p flattering!  it's close-ish to my natural color tho.  just richer, i'd say
..............dorothea time 😏 #fe3h https://t.co/EycUq7NoOL
@Minorians @hayleyhime idk i have just had such an easier time with lines than the shady boys. maybe it's a different feel for legs v. arms bc i don't have any leg art yet
@AngelicDaze i'm under 1k/under 500 everywhere and this whole tag has given me so many other cosplayers to share who are in a similar boat  with how much emphasis is put on a numbers game it's nice
@hayleyhime i actually really enjoy getting lines but the shader needles have nearly ended me.  over my wrist bone???  i saw stars
@hayleyhime @Minorians that is shader needles erasure  and yessss he's looking so good!!!!!
