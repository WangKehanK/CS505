Gilbert police do their jobs please challenge
She got off with “no probable cause” and I got a misdemeanor for disorderly conduct?? But she’s the felon and the thief ??
Tell me how this is fair??? The cops come to my house last Thursday because my sister stole a whole bunch of my things, we both get arrested me who has no record gets charged and my sister who is a felony &amp; stole my shit that night DOESNT get charged ...? Fuck police
@Sonnielazenby1 I hate it here
The amount of quirky 14 year olds that obsess over drug addiction and think it’s cool is so disturbing

I really need a therapist who is open 24/7 and not busy when I need them :/
I’m so tired of my dad telling me to stop being the way I am when I have fucking bpd I can’t help it I’m mentally ill. I’m so tired of my dad not understanding my illness
My life will forever be miserable with my sister in it. I wish the justice system did anything about it.
I have lost interest in everything I love.

I can totally see Nikita say “I’m vaccinated babe xoxo stop trying to cancel me”
I’m not ready for the wave of influencers who are going to start lying and saying they have got vaccinated so they don’t get cancelled for going to places without masks
