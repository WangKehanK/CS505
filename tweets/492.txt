Senator Blackburn, My dad is 73, and he voted for you! Don't you think you want to keep them alive to Keep your Job, instead of funneling money to the Military?? https://t.co/1lh0E0bBQg
Half of that, from what I've heard, is going to be covered by Amtrak. Something tells me you're being told to decline this by car manufacturers... https://t.co/uMlmg1HjRx
man, you're acting like putting more money to the National Weather Service and NOAA, helping us be safe for weather emergencies is a bad thing. Look, do you want $20 Million in weather emergency upgrades, or do you want $20 Trillion in damages from Tornadoes. https://t.co/92N83RH8Tq

I've been accused of being a Tom Brady defender a few years ago but in reality, I'm a Boston Defender, and I have to say...I think Boston is doing just fine without him (other than the Pats missing the Playoffs) https://t.co/5owEORbM2b

I regret doing content for china uncensored
The People's Republic of China and Falun Gong are in a fucking war man, like one side harvests organs and the other side posts propaganda that leads to Far-Right terrorism. Both sides suck, it's like watching Donald Trump and Xi Jingping in a boxing match, in the end, nobody wins

Here is a similar design where the white circle is removed and it instantly looks less nazi-ish. (Design by u/anarchist_snufkin from r/leftistvexillology) https://t.co/9VYzJSULzW
So, Right Wing journalists like Walsh, B.Johnson, and Posobiec are calling the United Farm Workers flag a "Nazi Flag"...and...yeah they have a good case here, it looks, very nazi-esque. https://t.co/wYrrTL4v7r

@gorycoryhorror reminds me of the one funny joke Jeff Dunham ever did.  "Your ass is on fire" "It's a Dry Heat!"
harassing a few people because they had the audacity to stay at a Japanese Airbnb.  So yeah, those are my two cents on the mythical beast known as "cancel culture". I hope you learned something, but probably not.
parking ticket according to a lot of people.  Oh yeah and I'm still reeling from a couple of dumb mistakes I did, like harassing someone at FWA, sending a creepy letter to a YouTuber just to make him block me just cause I had a crush on him and wanted it to stop, to
So I guess, and this comes from someone else, when I see people be leniant about Lindsay Ellis or Contrapoints, I get mad mainly because I was unfairly punished growing up, and that I want to, basically see them in the streets dying over what is essentially the equivalent of a
I was...abused growing up. I would be, basically cut off from my friends, by my mother, for doing anything minor, from losing a spoon or fork, to getting a B in geometry. One of the reasons why I don't really have friendships that last very long.
have told me that I've kind of been the "Defender of Cancel Culture" or something and I think I can understand why...  So this is gonna get real personal real fast so, you have been warned.
circle of hell.  So, she made a bad take, do I think she needed to, at least clarify what she said so it's less likely to be misconstrued? Definitely. Do I also think there are (white) people who went a little overboard towards her? A little bit.   Now a couple of people
clarify what you meant and apologize, or apologize and rephrase it a little, that's what I'd do.  Anyway, she didn't do either, she called those legitimately criticized her "crazy" and deactivated her account which is kinda cowardly but then again, Twitter is the 1st
wasn't racially motivated, especially considering that she's a leftist creator, and someone who deep dives into media. However, if something seemingly benign is misconscrewed as possibly racist, or at the very least tone-deaf, then it's your job to either
to another piece of East Asian influenced media and a lot of Asian Americans, from what I've heard, just went "could you please say something else other than comparing this to avatar, we've heard it all before.", which I would agree with. Now I get that it most likely
like the whole conservative movement against Lil Nas X, for DARING to have a video showing him giving Satan a Lapdance. Oh my Puritan heart.   Now, on to Lindsay Ellis. I think she made a bad take that got people riled up. She compared one piece of East Asian influenced media
someone who rightly faced the consequences of their actions (Morgan Wa--en)  But I think, I'm willing to change my whole "9 out of 10" Ratio to a more realistic 7 out of 10, because like, there are people who are actively trying to "cancel" others
So, my stance on "Cancel Culture" has changed a little bit after doing a little soul searching and having a good cry last night.  I still think that most of the time, people complaining about it are either making a Mountian out of a Molehill (dr. seuus) or people defending
