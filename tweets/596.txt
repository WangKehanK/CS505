@Ben_Fred @dgoold @ryanfagan Ben, please don’t kill the best beat writer in the game like that.
Shout out to Bugles. Always underrated and underestimated, and they’re always delicious.
@echochlo Unironically very proud of her. Great job!
@GameOverGreggy But I had listened to Podcast Beyond for years before that.
@GameOverGreggy It was you and Colin talking about ants. I knew we were in for something special.
@Z_Burr Your most impressive platinum is the one you only almost got.
@Z_Burr Yes, Battleborn. That’s the one. Everyone remembers that game. What was it about? That’s the Dark Souls game, right?
@Z_Burr I agree with one and have no opinion on three of them. That’s a net positive, so you live.
@BR_MLB @MLB *THIS* is a wild play? Seriously. That’s as routine as it gets, not even a dramatic photo-finish on the slide.
Invincible Compendium 2 does this weird thing of calling every issue “chapter”. It starts with “Chapter 48.” Not a big deal, except the first compendium always used “issue.” Compendium 1 ends with “Issue 47.” Strange.
@RyanHigginsRyan It’s the camaraderie that hooks me. Just some buds chillin’, talking about baseball and MVMT watches.

May the fourth be with y- and he’s dead. https://t.co/WkCZLkMxaj
Crazy that we say “gold” and “silver” instead of “shiny yellow” and “shiny grey”.
Best video of 2021. https://t.co/BSi12fvVVN
@MLBRandomStats And there’s a good chance they won’t have more after this series... until they return to Coors.
@jeskeets @Bucks @NoDunksInc 0-3 on 3PA. Clearly overrated. /s
I remember now why I once considered Invincible my favorite comic book. It’s amazing. I’m 26 issues into my re-read, and having a blast.
@Kofie Closest we’re ever gonna get to a real one. Thanks, Kofi.
@MLBRandomStats How dare he not be at 818, what a joke. /s
I don’t care that he hasn’t been good in a decade, I don’t care that he left St. Louis. I love Albert Pujols. Still the greatest hitter I’ve ever seen in person. https://t.co/LZEzHbuEFJ
@winnersusedrugs You know what they say, winners use drugs.
Fun things they don’t tell you about being an adult: I had to file for a lost title on my car today, because I don’t know what the fuck happened to the last one, but it no longer exists in this dimension. Turns out ya gotta have proof you own it before you can sell it. Who knew?
@ZachariusD @garfep @jmdornbush 1) He’s too handsome
@JoanNiesen This is such a cool idea for a podcast. Can’t wait to listen, Joan!
Pepper Jack cheese, ketchup, bread and butter pickles, and mushrooms. https://t.co/6qe4JEQl5x
@zachsilver Also his name is spelled “Stevan” this time. Sorry if I ruined the joke, but a lot of people miss these things.
@stlCupofJoe Maybe I’m crazy, but his curve didn’t look at “12-6” as it once was when he was struggling. Nice to see that even if that was just perception, the numbers back it up.
@MaximumCortez @Nick_Scarpino That’s fucked up, totally boycotting the Jabroni Boi now.
@SlangsOnSports WAR by free agency dollars have Lindor worth $50 mil a season so far in his career. He keeps that up for even half of the 10 years, this deal will look good. Those last couple years won’t look pretty, of course.
@MaximumCortez I’m already having anxiety about my favorite streamer being gone. Who do I watch play Mario? Do I still support KF even though the conspiracy theories say they did it? Why does @Nick_Scarpino suddenly have an acoustic guitar?
@ScottMillerBbl Maybe now he’ll finally be fired. Hasn’t deserved a job in years, part of me wonders if that’s why he sued. So they/the umpire’s union couldn’t fire him.
@DiGiorno Thank you for supporting my homies @KindaFunnyVids. Super chill.
Digiorno Croissant pizza is fucking delicious. I once was a skeptic, but now, I believe.
Republican. I assumed you meant “very smart”. https://t.co/Cv4ZQLb2eO
@SadBoyBarrett You sure you wanna bring back Nintendo’s worst year ever?
The Compendiums of Invincible are so massive (47 issues) they take 1.2GB of space to download. For pictures with words. Thats a lot of pictures and words.
@katiejwoo @stlCupofJoe @TheAthleticSTL Congrats on the gig! Looking forward to reading your work.
My friend and I finished watching “Kingdom” on Netflix. It’s one of the best shows nobody has seen. Damn good. Shame it only got three seasons.
This game changed my life. Never had my mind been blown by a video game. I was in awe of Kingdom Hearts, and I still kind of am. https://t.co/Hp9bUBLNq4
I turn my garage into a stoner hangout, Ali turns hers into a state of the art gym. Where did I go wrong in life? https://t.co/64EFFCx1gq
@shaunalshatti Time to start calling him Matt Luque, because he belongs on that list.
On this day tomorrow, 10 years ago, everyone realized the 3D sucked and turned it off permanently. XD https://t.co/CMWm4V4hiw
@Ben_Fred I’ve never been a Carp hater, but why is he still on the team? He can’t hit the broadside of a barn this spring.
Watching the @NoDunksInc boys talk about bobcats. They’re such cool animals. https://t.co/fQ3I2G4i6h
@syrtis_ @BoterfNumber5 @jon_bois What if I haven’t watched racing of any kind since everybody hated Jeff Gordon?
@BoterfNumber5 @jon_bois Right, I can never tell if it’s Funny Jon or Serious Jon. Replies seem to agree with him, for what it’s worth.
My mother got her first COVID vaccine today. She doesn’t like needles, and I’m very proud of her.
@tangotiger Question doesn’t make much sense, it can’t be higher if the first month is limited capacity most places.
This would change the lives of millions in a positive way, myself included. So of course, they won’t do it. https://t.co/GL9pKXDKiD
Good. Fuck racists, homophobes, transphobia, bigots, and every other discriminatory group out there. https://t.co/J4bk4LA9F8
@Jordan15369789 @ReneePaquette Stop being pathetic, it’s pathetic.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is another amazing MCU show. It’s so good. Mackie and Stan have excellent chemistry.
Donald Duck helps to save the world - again! https://t.co/Jk1P4vbXW5
Suddenly he finds his “humanity” after four years as the most inhumane and worst President in US history. What a shock. https://t.co/bm5KCYPwty
Why do people love this country? https://t.co/ZaJknu4x7L
@baseball_ref “Decide who is better”, that’s adorable. For their careers, there is no comparison.
@imranzomg Shoulda just got one of these. The height of 20th century technology. https://t.co/PCYVmZpqmW
Still my favorite album of all time, what a masterpiece. https://t.co/7NNdUzTx4f
@NNTof1 Our governor just wishes he was Tr*mp. Seriously.
Yo Missouri, where you at? Oh yeah, being fucking stupid and worthless as always. https://t.co/f9Sg0kO0Sz
@SlangsOnSports One of the great “what could have been” players of this generation. That man could have been a Hall of Famer.
@Wario64 “Only available for pick-up”  Fuuuuuuuuu
@TheEricGoldman I like the second better because of the villain. The dude in the first movie is the most forgettable MCU villain this side of Malekith in Dark World. I also just found it more fun. Structurally, though, you’re probably correct.
@HavokRose I just assumed you turned British on us.
Today I learned Boruto is the greatest snack in the world. I mean, anime character. https://t.co/CcXhLtuUup
I’d be cool with movie theaters going away forever. I realize this may be my most unpopular take. https://t.co/viHolBWGiE
@cadenzapicaro LIES. I go away for a few weeks and someone has *brainwashed* you!?
@cadenzapicaro What about “Persona is amazing”?
I love animals. They’re so much better than humans. https://t.co/XwkUSOHsY1
@TheEricGoldman Just tell them when it blows, none of it will matter.
@Brucewaynebrady Well good news, you need to go home, you’re clearly drunk. XD
You ever get drunk and realize you gotta be awake for another eight hours? Happened to me.
@MaximumCortez @LudwigAhgren @KindaFunnyVids @alexandravbotez @itsandreabotez Man, bullshit they don’t show the Nitro Rifle there. Most famous Twitch streamer in the world.
@JoshBlackStPete @JonMayerSI @FoolishBB He played 11 years with the Cardinals. That’s more than 10.
