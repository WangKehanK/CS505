@Hell2DoAnything my own hanahaki au is i think subconsciously my rebelling against these tropes 😂
@Hell2DoAnything family and friends should be supportive and SILENT
@Hell2DoAnything it’s just that i don’t like demeaning the main cp in a story i think... it’s not for me not in this way
@Hell2DoAnything i hate this so so much omg it’s insane how popular it is for how much it sucks to read
@bearlylele this is a good way to put it!!!! bend someone over the counter and i’m back
I FORGOT MY BIG ONE when meddling family members try to set up one of the main pairing to the point where they’re honestly hurting them and very invasive https://t.co/HDA1DbhFCX
@pakhnokh it’s a rollercoaster
@bearlylele ahhh i would never say never but something about it has always bored me... if i rly trusted an author i’d dive in anyway but i almost never meet with success there
personal tastes entirely of course and the usually is very much in play for some of these... infidelity/cuckholding, coffee shop aus, cop/govt aus, post-apocalyptic, time travel fix its unless that’s part of the original canon https://t.co/HDA1DbhFCX
@gusuvibes i always love this
@withoutstories HEHEHEHEHE

@YunmengLotus if wwx called him noodle in verse he would absolutely ask him to send noods.

@WangxianBond oh yeah for sure... i don’t even mean hate in this case so much as it’s making lwj miserable forever just as part of an au for another ship 😔 which is its own battle
@Chenqing_Bichen exactly 😤😤😤😤😤
@WangxianBond yeah i get it bc i hate ppl that i’m sure are others’ faves but my anchoring bias is so strong

@lanbaobei3 I DONT KNOW 😭
@WangxianBond you are lucky and blessed 😔
@WangxianBond i genuinely cannot get over it every time i see it i take a knife to the chest
like i am mostly down to be like “think your thoughts they cannot hurt me” but these thoughts. they hurt me
every time i am reminded that people in the world hate lwj and want to see him miserable forever: https://t.co/V2sYNpdOia
