Just seriously so broken up about Vin/ny at Vi//ne//sau/ce. I've been watching him for years and years and idk what to think. I'm just so so so upset. All I hope is that it all turns out okay in the end.

@doeantlers Obsessed with this video. The hedonism. The pure joy. The absolute thrill of coating oneself in dirt, in one video.
Oops we had a power outage let's play Hades again | !discord !quote !links https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
First Time Playing Hades!! Let's fall in bi love with every mythical greek figure https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Putt-Putt: Back to the Future or something https://t.co/stUbZ0W6HS
Bonus Stream of Some Stardew to Chill Out  https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Just the sheer tone deafness of some straight people who would call themselves allies. Do you even hear yourself? Fuck's sake.
"Oh yeah, I'm super accepting of LGBTs!!! I haven't shot a homosexual to death or anything so you can basically call me an ally, hahah! 😉"
@MorganeMiam Thank you!!!! I love my rainbow bows so much
@lildreamysoul Thank you so much!!! The top is just a tiny bit out of my comfort zone, but I absolutely love the look so I'm happy to hear I'm pulling it off!!!
Feeling adventurous with the colors today... 💖🌈🌼 https://t.co/pKG2wGfSEV
I think today I'll treat myself to drawing some self insert/selfship stuff. I am loving on Elliott something fierce, and Sidon's been on my mind, too!
An updated commission sheet, I realized the one I had pinned was outdated! https://t.co/j0SbVUIoa0
This week's stream schedule! Excited to play Putt-Putt again~ https://t.co/w81DpAzW7V
Some More Late Night Stardew Chillin' https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Late Night Stardew Chillin'~ ✨🌱 https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
So, scheduling conflict came up, my USB hub I plug my controllers into broke, and I, a fool, am finding myself cancelling Hades again 😅 Majora might have to be put aside for a bit too... But I'll probably play more Stardew tonight and tomorrow instead. Possibly later than usual.
Just found out I can put hats on my babies!!!!! #StardewValley #SDV #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/EN5BkDLlkF
@itiswattles The voice of Wattles is soothing at least and phantasmagorical at most, and confirmed to be the finest voice to accompany hella great Minecraft vids. 👌
Some god awful country music is playing at the auto mechanic's place 😬😬😬🤢🤢🤢
Stardewin' it, babey! Year 2 here we come! https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Sorta Sad Stardew Hours begin now babeyyyyy https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Also! Paper Mario is giving me some issues today... 🙄 So I think we'll just do a Stardew stream tonight instead.
Just set up Streamlabs Decks on my tablet, let's see how this works tonight 😎
This week's stream schedule! Will actually do Hades on Friday this time 😂 #streamersontwitch #twitchstreamer https://t.co/39caVjD6bh
Stardewin' It Babey https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Thinkin of a bonus Stardew stream tonight 👀👀👀 I figured out what the hell was going wrong with it yesterday so now I'm hankerin' for some farmin'
Change of plans - Stardew was poopin' itself so we ended the stream a lil early 😭 Sorry guys. BUT I might do a bonus stream tomorrow or Monday to make up for the short stream tonight! Stay tuned 💖
Back to the Mask: Majungula's Mask https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Was feeling a little adventurous with colors I don't often use in my makeup... Dunno how much of a "be seen in public" kind of look this is but I wish I could figure out how to make it one! 🥺 https://t.co/0QEINZ9um8
(watches my own Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo highlights video like some kind of megalomaniac) Hilarious. This bitch gets it.
let's mellow out with Stardew Valley https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Feeling a little Bleh:tm: today, idk how ready I am to start a brand new game, so I think I'm going to turn it into a Stardew Valley stream tonight instead. Sorry for anyone who wanted to see Hades!!!
Sending support ticket number two to Twitch concerning my affiliate status, 'cause I've been stuck at "under review" for approximately 22 business days now, and at least a month if you count weekends... hoping they can tell me more than "just keep waiting :) " this time.
god I hate dealing with health insurance shit 😩
or might move to RedBubble? Idk. I'm having A Time™ thinking about it
Considering opening a Teespring store, maybe? Move some of my designs over from TeePublic.....
This tiny idiot 😂😂😂 Love our dumb baby so much. Idk why he doesn't like toys being in his tower but he's adamant about it 😤 #kittens #toysdontbelonginthecattower2k21 https://t.co/S1Zamg5wxT
Woke up with literally everything being stressful in some way so I think I am just going to go back to sleep 😬

Papering the Marios yet again! https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Finally got PJ64 set up to work with my wired Switch controller, really happy about it! We never use this controller on the Switch since we got the wireless one so now it's my PC gaming controller 🎮✨
The sunshine is honestly the source of my power, I'm a happy fairy today ☀️✨ https://t.co/gX2dXL7pXQ

Time to Play Majorpo's Mask! 🎭 https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
Alternative (alternatul?) fanart for Cool Cat that I did while watching a few reviews with my partner. Cool Cat loved to boogie woogie but now he's not so sure the child star life was so good to him after all. https://t.co/OFusxrjWyn
Been a hot minute since my last piece of art! Little fanart for @AudaxSmoke , the mad lad who turned his first playthrough into a 100% run. Wild as hell and extremely fun to watch. Congrats again, man! #TTYD #PaperMario #fanart https://t.co/0rIeyuVmdC
A little obsessed with editing my overlay to suit my games. Excited for Majora's Mask tomorrow! https://t.co/GG3nf0icCh
Little bonus stream where we just dink around in Los Santos as Trevor https://t.co/Bs6ZSWZs1K
Gonna play GTAV again, hope this doesn't awaken anything in me
@Q_Review Imagine your money meaning so little to you that you spend a grand on books that still definitely exist in multitudes
We Are Stardewin' It! https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
@Q_Review I literally cannot stand another moment of this world I cannot take it.
Paper Mario time let's GOOOO 🍄📖 https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
@LuigiOdyssey I love a happy ending
Might do a little art stream today during the day, I wanna get some channel stuff drawn like sub badges and channel point graphics.
I am SO excited to play Paper Mario tonight!!!
I did it I putted a putt! Here's highlights of the Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo stream. Mature warning that I think might be mandatory for a baby game: I swear a ton.  https://t.co/Ah3yl5eM5l
Made a highlights video of my Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo stream! Can't wait to share it with you guys!
Let's 🚗 Go 🚗 Save 🚗 The 🚗 ZOO 🦒🐘🐍🦛🦁 https://t.co/stUbZ1dI6s
