@MLive complete waste. then we wonder why our infrastructure is crumbling. we have too much of it to afford to maintain. more more more isn’t always the solution.
@bremondr @BrentToderian @QAGreenways hyperloop , as innovative and cool as it sounds is a complete bust. People do not understand how difficult it is to keep something at near vacuum.
While EVs are not a green as they’re made out to be, the potential is promising. Battery technology is getting exponentially better (and cleaner) https://t.co/DYCvyFHVVo
@bxrrier @harringtunes @itsAntWright No way, that’s what makes march madness march madness. The lower seed teams would mostly like lose and pretty much make it NBA style where nothing really too crazy happens
Man Gonzaga really picked a bad time to lose their first game
Ordering a car through vroom has been the most painful experience ever 😩😩 never again
Detroit could never 😞😞😞 https://t.co/jsNUfhlihY
Hell of a game. UCLA has nothing to be ashamed of. Juzang is a hell of a player.
SUGGSS OMG!
Everyday i wake up and thank the lord for gifting us spanish music 💆🏽💆🏽
@umhoops we’re national champs if he stays healthy
@JoshLipnik looks livable and walkable until you look at the next block over and it’s filled with parking lots lol

@michaelpringle na, state fans never experienced the anxiety that comes with your team being in the tournament
@michaelpringle i’m gonna need that don julio back i gave you for your wedding gift 🥴
@michaelpringle still won’t be enough to take this pain away 😂😂😂
@michaelpringle i need a lil more than that, too many what if’s
@michaelpringle ☠️☠️🤣
@avizek44 @BarstoolUofM very true. franz and mike for a combined 7 points. should of been benched at end.
@BarstoolUofM Howard needs to start making good adjustments when his team is down at the half. Hasn’t proved to do that well quite yet. We’ve lost pretty much every game when down at the half.
@michaelpringle delete this before it makes it on cold takes 😂
Michigan beat Michigan. 54% from the free throw line &amp; 14 turnovers.  Frank and Mike with a combined 7 points. We were lucky to only lose by 2 with a chance to win it at the end. We’ll be back next year stronger  #goblue  👊🏼〽️
mMike Smith wyd my man 🤦🏽‍♂️ didn’t even get a good look at it
Holy shit. Heart beat at 200 bpm
@michaelpringle LFG
@michaelpringle exactly, hopefully he’ll cool off second half
@michaelpringle lol too many turnovers, dickinson has to start playing smarter
@DetroitStreetVu had to check the location... thought this was somewhere in the suburbs lol
@DE_Gifford to be fair, electric cars use up much less brake material due to regenerative braking.  In some cases they last for the life of the car.
@michaelpringle exactly. as long as we don’t have a performance like vs illinois and msu we’ll be fine.
@michaelpringle 100%. I don’t thing neither team would stand a chance tho
@michaelpringle ended up choking in OT lol
BAMA WITH THE BUZZER OMGGGG
@bobingham0 @crowdpleazer2 @Ford i just got a model 3 bc of price point, other than that i would of got a mustang mach e. Seems like a great car.
@bobingham0 @crowdpleazer2 @Ford yup, 100% marketing. which is smart bc it brought a lot of attention (whether you agree or not) to their future line up of EVs. The mustang name behind it means they are serious about EVs
@DE_Gifford @clickondetroit i live in livonia and i must say it pretty nice to live here for all of the mentioned reasons in the article. nice, clean, safe, accessible. The neighborhoods themselves are walkable but step onto main roads and u better watch out. our “dtown” is sad if you can even call it one.
@bobingham0 @Ford i think people are just salty about the name hahah
@Jesse69767947 @Ford my 2008 escape has 275k on it and still going strong. As long as you take care of them they’ll last
@Jesse69767947 @Ford geeezz how many engines?
@53viroqua drawing shows 11 rows of windows, current shows 7
@53viroqua was this building shaved at some point?
@Casey best bang for your buck for sure
I’m surprised Michigan dropped 86 despite having 12 turnovers. Gotta clean it up in the next round.
mike smith is committing too many mental errors!!
@detroitkristin @DE_Gifford every single one. i look 4 teams each way regardless if i have the right of way or not.
@esav333 hi 😂😁 https://t.co/EQASKkFJhQ
@esav333 CRY 😂😂😂 #suckeyes
@bbowman_ @Ford they need to come out with the Ranger Raptor asap 🤪🤪
hb that Oral??? @OhioStateHoops  😂😂😂
@yfreemark it will only get better. We trust computers with our daily lives why not with driving?
