#KiaAllStarMVP Stephen Curry
Nothing feels better than that post football CTE headache 🥰
I have never in my life seen such bad refs. Warriors getting fleeced
I’m gonna have a stroke watching Steve Kerr and his garbage rotations.
I swear why will Kerr not put Wiseman in
I swear Wiggins is so bad

The fact that finals is stretched over two weeks had taken years of my life.
Kelly oubre too cute 😍
Nevada loves to run the ball when they’re down big in the 4th.
Nevada playing like trash, holy shit.
I’m gonna cry myself to sleep after finals
I’ve developed PTSD from my morning alarm sound.

@TKeane45 In 4th grade, I walked into the bathroom once and a kid was naked squatting on the toilet like Gollum. This was a traumatizing moment

The election won't get called until either John King or Steve Kornacki gets stretchered off.
Holy shit, Romeo Doubs better be picked first overall.
Trump sounds like when someone tries to talk to you when your sleeping.

@charliekirk11 Hey, I know I just learned this in AP Gov but you should check out NYT V. United States.
Dontae Johnson been on the 49ers since I was born.
49ers need to just forfeit this game. The Giants aren't worth another 5 injured starters.
They're using old carpet for turf at MetLife. This ain't real.
Imma need the 49ers to grab Gore and Kaepernick real quick.
Burrow should've pulled an Eli Manning. The Bengals oline is a crime against humanity
Tyler Herro build different
The United Nations needs to do an investigation. What the hell. https://t.co/ReH1ww0A4E

@hanklerfist @WCSDTweet We only have the fall to play, y'all got all that time once a vaccine out to do whatever
@realDonaldTrump Don't ignore that ole Donny begged Xi Jinping for campaign help
If I find out any of you actually voted for Kanye, were not friends anymore.
