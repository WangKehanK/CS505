i think the jump scares on tiktok are so funny because i used tumblr a lot and on tumblr there was like such strict no jump scares police lmao

i’ve been really working on using only they/them pronouns like no matter what gender the person i’m speaking to is but it’s really hard

i love embracing new styles like why would we want the same thing all the time

i had to cut a friend off recently (well not rly cut her off cuz she wasn’t hitting me up rly) but she used me as a therapist hardcore and she was like actually a super fucked up person and comforting her made me feel sick (no one from twitter)

@itslaneybxtch feel like if people see me saying it they will get the idea they can say it too idkkk
@itslaneybxtch I don’t think it’s okay for white passing mixed people to say it but that’s just my opinion i guess like i’m half black and not white passing and even tho i was called the n word in my racist ass school i never felt like wanting to say it and i live in a mostly white area so i
@itspcakes @nwaknine @nodoubt2044 @ucanthandlez @BAnkenmann @APr0Perspective @_clxtchzillaa__ @HalleDria i get that but that doesn’t mean anybody has any obligation whatsoever to let someone they don’t know go ahead of them in line. and please trust that i have a lot of empathy, but not for people who need coffee fast, that just makes no sense. once again, it is COFFEE
@itspcakes @nwaknine @nodoubt2044 @ucanthandlez @BAnkenmann @APr0Perspective @_clxtchzillaa__ @HalleDria you gotta be trolling bro
@HalleDria where are all the angry white peoples who say “i just let people cut me in line” at??? question for you: how do you even get your coffee if you just let everyone go first? i’m all confused
@nwaknine @itspcakes @nodoubt2044 @ucanthandlez @BAnkenmann @APr0Perspective @_clxtchzillaa__ @HalleDria forreallll people are acting like she said “no you can’t cut in line even tho your baby is dying”. like what could POSSIBLY be so important you need to stop at starbucks first? i’m lost
@BAnkenmann @APr0Perspective @_clxtchzillaa__ @HalleDria she did just say no?
i tho k we should just get rid of the internet
