@prettynotdead @KaiaSinclair Lol caps. Be straight fire, but also pure hell . Lmao
@AIChevrier @xo__kiagold @justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU Yes even if you don't want to hear it, listen to the spirit and strive to stay away from that evil.  Once you break the chain, I promise you you will be renewed. I'm living the proof of it all.
@xo__kiagold @justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU I know it hurts but it's for the betterment of your spirit, you may not feel better now, but future you is thanking you. I've been through that with the ex I was with, it hurt to see them everyday after we broke up bc I was still under the hold
Yo I be leveling up my soul and my ass is totally seeing clearly. Is this adulthood. Wow. I'm seeing through mfs even more now
@justenross_ @MsMichelleBebe @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU Forreal, burning the Palo Santo to dispel the negative energy. One time I unknowingly burned it right after she left my apt ü•¥ spirit knew.. I feel bad that they live under imposter syndrome. Don't know who they are so they mimic.
@MsMichelleBebe @justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU Damn I'm sorry that happened to you. They really are out there trying their hardest to manipulate Us.
@justenross_ @MsMichelleBebe @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU Then they go "what about me?" "You ALWAYS TALK ABOUT YOUR SELF, WHAT ABOUT ME" like I've always am mindful of everyone and am genuinely asking to know about my friends, but apparently the gas is lit...
@justenross_ @MsMichelleBebe @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU Oh my gosh yes, ask you how you're doing, then listen and say they're happy for you but backhand and say "I resent you for being a bad friend" lol SIS I SHOULD RESENT YOU BUT DONT BECAUSE IM NOT SPITEFUL.
@MsMichelleBebe @justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU The fucking manipulation got me and my fuckin waffle. Now I'm not sharing food with nobody but my family.

@MsMichelleBebe @justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU I let our friendship fade, even though I tried to maintain parts of it. They then told a group of "our" friends they were going to ghost me on our last meet. The bitch ate my waffle and I was only mad that she ate it before she told me we weren't going to be friends anymore.
@MsMichelleBebe @justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU I wish I had caught it early, but I dated them for 2.5 years, then continued a friendship after we broke up. I was still under the manipulation, so I stayed friends. But once I was on my own forreal I started to see how they truly were from the outside.
@justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU I'm glad the cord was severed by them even though I cried a little. I felt like a weight was lifted after I grieved.
@justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU It truly does hurt each time it happens, and we fall for it because we are genuinely good. They have no remorse because they don't believe they were in the wrong at all. And I always wondered why my energy was drained &amp; I felt so isolated and unseen. Real abuse.
@SimplyShelbs16 @TheOracleReadsU Me with two thus far.
@justenross_ @Makepapr @TheOracleReadsU Yep, once they figure out they don't hold a place in your life or that they can't control you anymore, they tell you you were the "bad friend" and discontinue your friendship/ relationship.   Which in turn confuses you when you were the one who actually tried.
