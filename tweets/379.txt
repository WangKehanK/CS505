@ComicContext The only thing this needs is a skull on a pole!
@busty_mcchesty The üòà is actually a telepathic link to a psychic network  comprised of mischievous, horny devils that when complete will result in the biggest  [content removed due to the extreme, explicit nature of the material] that anyone has witnessed!
@LaylaLu8 The right one, it has an early 60's feel.
@FemdomTherapy However I am still trying to be everybody's hash brownie covered with ice cream and Kuala.
@BriannaWu I see no crime, he's just napping before he gets back to doing that jigsaw puzzle.
@MixtrixFix So much better did its competitor brand "Shout" the brand that lets everyone know that it's in use!
@stacy_whiplash you need another form of transportation, May I suggest... https://t.co/ecbK0Uhafz
@MissIsobelDevi I'm positive Dale Evens was tied up every show and couldn't escape it even in the comics... https://t.co/vfVfQWXeo9
@MissIsobelDevi when I was very young there were tons of westerns playing, in almost every show someone would be tied up, gagged etc. also the variety shows had lots of escape artists who were tied up on stage. Later I was a big fan of the avengers(think Mrs Peel not Thor). https://t.co/DhdLm2pdFs
@FemdomTherapy his exhaust is sticking out!
@FemdomTherapy and I'm the same old crazy
@DaeKwonJenkins @kylegriffin1 It seems that I live in broward and got vaccinated at publix. https://t.co/McSFWrkIwx
@busty_mcchesty I was checking my transporter pad, but no Brownies appeared...However I see you have a tralfamidorian sneaking around, face down on the floor. If you're quiet it'll never know you are there and you can sneak out!
@FemdomTherapy rhyme time at phrases guys ignore...  your dick is too small it's no use at all your balls are too big you disgusting pig your back full of hair should be covered with Nair and your chest is man tits in a bra they should fit
@FemdomTherapy I go down easier with Kaluha and ice cream with  gummies...
@FemdomTherapy Aye yai yai...
@FemdomTherapy however, I would love to have you force him to deep throat the one flip and deep anal the other flop and send him onto Tucker  with the opening line "remember when we..."
@FemdomTherapy It isn't April yet! it's only March 32...
@LaylaLu8 I hope this isn't April fools...
@LaylaLu8 I am so excited for you, What a life changer! you give me hope that one of my lottery schemes will come thru!
@busty_mcchesty Sorry, I'm Maquis...
@mistresslienne This deeply disturbs me, and I have no solutions. We are a sick and violent society that has no will to become a just and inclusive people,  That a fool can take another's life out of hate... I can only pray that both of you and all lives that touch you remain safe.
@sherrylever I want it!!!
@DommeTomorrow However there is this - GOLF --&gt; Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden...
@thejayyshow There would be a world of smiles if you reacted to DREAD ZEPPELIN  - Stairway to Heaven... https://t.co/CZjQhXFZq7
I would also add Dangerous, like a monkey with a machinegun!üêí https://t.co/iEkO9EMm9M
@FemdomTherapy üò• My life is a constant reminder...
@anj_els I fondly remember my 1960 VW and can add a few more things to the list like no fan for the Heat, as long as you are going fast enough it was just fine. No fuel gauge but you did have a fuel switch with off,  normal and reserve - still no problem.
March and the March winds will soon be here, how many of these mangos will survive. https://t.co/Q70Yb3tJJ1
@SashaMizaree Yes!
@FemdomTherapy I awoke in a haze, It was one of those days, I had started eating those edibles at dawn, Found nude in a barn, Being disciplined by a school marm, She said our conclusion is forgone , She said your dick is too small, It's no threat at all, But that can't be said for my strapon.
@FemdomTherapy @MixtrixFix @LadyJSaysSo Of course they look cozy and inviting, for they are the Insidious and deceptive minions of a larger invading Force! BEWARE!
@MixtrixFix Makes me wish I could have complish quantum teleportation from drive to drive
@olympiamusic @DommeTomorrow Love Georgette who channels a dead squirrel  me Pearl.
@Lexual__ You are amazing!
@suzannah_bitch @Cybill_Troy Future sports: after bronco busting was made illegal due to cruelty the sport of timed extreme sub bounce pegging was introduced...
@Cybill_Troy This only makes sense if people are bringing  their own tables with them...
@fyofyolinette @PulpLibrarian Well, smack my ass and call me fungus
@mistresslienne If you it will so please I will be on my knees
@mistresslienne 27 seconds...
@GoddessSevera Dark Matter Matters!
@GoddessSevera You could leave the door open, I ain't goin' nowhere!
@Aftern00ndelite @875OT7 @kylegriffin1 As long as that attitude prevails we will remain a divided nation.
@Aftern00ndelite @875OT7 @kylegriffin1 As I said , that is Trumpism. Empathy goes a long way especially since we haven't seen it for 4 years.
@JoeBiden After my participation in the included tweet I wanted to further express several thoughts. The prevailing feelings of fear and helplessness invoke the need to punish the "others" and we are this way because of the looming specter of the loss of everything we know... https://t.co/oTYCo3Dbhq
@875OT7 @kylegriffin1 Angel what you are espousing is trumpism. Only help those who help you, that philosophy has no place in civilized society. Think of the United States and all the living beings with in it as one body. What hurts one hurts all.
@JennSlowpez @Love_bug1016 I will not be writing poems for any of you, Because my talents for meter and rhyme are few, Believe me cause what I tell you is true, I'd rather write my replys with letters few, Then get wasted with a big fat joint...(doesn't rhyme does it)
@QuizGriz Only 17 because they are so bored of questions like 'what is the first letter of stupid' that they quit.
@thighcandy Attack of the killer tomatoes
@thighcandy The Raven
@thighcandy Yentl
@Hey_joeb @santori_lisa All are a pitiful attempt by fearful childish minds whose lives are ruled by delusional paranoia.
@MixtrixFix Of course you want max coverage, but with Texas grabbing all the attention it was probably not a good idea. Maybe if they drag kanye away in a straight jacket they can get their numbers...
@MissIsobelDevi Sounds like this should be in the Guinness Book of World Records!
The real deep state! https://t.co/W4BdVNBvhq
@RaeUvLite We also need to deraticalize society and identify the dangerously mentally ill. The least we could do is criminalize assault weapons. You don't need an AR15 to hunt bambi or defend yourself.
@RaeUvLite Unfortunately if these were implemented in schools, the kids would be sitting ducks for anyone who would also bring gas and a match.  We need a better solution.
@FemdomTherapy üí©üí®üí• these hieroglyphics found in an ancient tomb now make sense. previously misinterpreted as the way to heaven.
@MotherOfDasypus I must agree with your dad!
@iseenudepeople The gore factor of Yondu using a can of ravioli or SpaghettiOs instead of an arrow would be off the chart.
@MDiamondblu Whoa, this is sure to cause a brain overload in those who have no idea what a turntable is!
@dancingchimera @busty_mcchesty It may seem just a bit crass But this is a tweet about the hole in my a**
@busty_mcchesty I thought I did too, but it was the satin panties I slipped into.üò≥

@Denise_Masino Looks like a woodpecker
@mistress_london That is a great look!
@petsupermarkets  #cats #thoughtoftheday #prime I have just learned that you no longer do a free bag for every 10, since amazon prime sells for less it looks like I will be ending my association with you. Good bye.
@MixtrixFix Those cherry bombs must have been good because he had about 6 in 2 hours and the bartender isn't staying up till 3 for his health. He should concider minimum wage should be at least $15  and he should tip at least $30 for his labor.  If it is so dirty and disgusting why stay?
@FemdomTherapy $ü•ìü•Ø,ü•Øü•Øü•Ø.ü•Øü•Ø Seems about right.
@FLDominatrix If I was there it would not hit the floor.
@ThePrincessMiki Smoke a fat joint, receive some head, and take a nap. I always get to 1 and seem to skip to 3, bummer! I should just put your test pictures in front of me and at least I wouldn't skip to 3 so fast...
@mizztreasure I could truly say, you are a dream!
@StormyDaniels If Einstein was still around she would most likely write:   You are so stupid, you get paid to write some nonsense like e=mc^2 it is just letters and a superscript number. You should get a real job like taking out the trash, so just remove yourself. Hahahahaha
@StormyDaniels If I could get paid to have sex and have my naked body ogled, I'd do it in a second! And if truth be told so would any rational being!!!üôÇüëÄüëÄüëÄüíì
