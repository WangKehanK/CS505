police having to let them go bc they have literally no evidence or any reason to detain those people. no wonder superheroes are always fighting crime they never actually ARREST the criminals.
love the idea of superheroes. bad guys tied up and left in front of the police station, no explanation. who are they? what did they do? is there any proof? nope just a couple guys tied up with a note saying 'ur welcome ;)' as if that suffices.

one of my favorite tropes is when someone tries to bring someone they loved back to life in an act of desperation but you cant bring people back to life so they always come back slightly off or wrong or with a price and so the person has to watch them die a second time.
