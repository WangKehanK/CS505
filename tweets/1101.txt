@scoodotcom @akuttelbear @neurotard At least we agree on that.
@scoodotcom @akuttelbear @neurotard Bro yo head look like a brick
@GabrielFernanC @maximum Thatd cost them a lot of money though. Thousands and thousands.
@epicfailsale @Wowhead Yea it sucked. Did it in cata and it still took like a month or so. Although you could do it continuously I think.
@Photobioma @wvu2k2x Dont you dare say that blasphemy
@EsuMonk i wear raid finder ring from darkvein cause i cant get it to drop for me in at least normal and i needs the haste
@Fridgemuffin09 @AtomicDarth @BhdrDgrsz @GVBBlE @Warcraft No enough cat mounts
@Savage_Cheez @Wowhead How is it socialistic? Generally curious.
@XbcTV @maximum I kinda regret quitting during highmaul. I wish I could have experience current HFC.
@TheDuckMane @redditships https://t.co/foZPXEatpq
@qeefaays @ceeselena @ibussbins @LoHahn1 @QuitWoofin @Dayasweetheart Ok
@thekillakay_ I ask "which car" even though I only have one. They never know what to say.

@ibussbins @LoHahn1 @QuitWoofin @Dayasweetheart Shit, you got some?
@turakius @LindenMcGuigan @Wowhead Well didnt ya know? Hes the pvp god cause he got 1800.
@azjeep_26 @Warcraft No.
@maximum How would you get around that tho
@JoeyBowen321 @AwesomeBamon @freebirdjr29 @ElijahSchaffer No. You dont lol.
@EsuMonk Well guess my alt gonna be a monk
@BenDove02040365 @Ackbar117 @eagle4congress @realDonaldTrump Yes. They were counting. They don't put each vote in individually. Hammerskull.
@realDonaldTrump Hammers are definitely involved in your skull
@waitearmstrong Well it's not manual labor so it's not real work waite!!!!11!!
@Fawsterr @Wowhead Welcome to the survival hunter experience
@OfByForEveR @dvillella @realDonaldTrump If you dont think trump was trying to basically extort the GA sec of state then idk what to tell ya.
@mesatown480 @yano_ultima @Notveldii @Wowhead No.
@Endzeit_91 @mesatown480 @yano_ultima @Notveldii @Wowhead I do fine damage with survival and it's way more enjoyable than the other 2 specs imo. Thank you my dude
@yano_ultima @Notveldii @Wowhead Welcome to the survival hunter experience
@saoz04967459 @cowboybegoth @pep19921 @Warcraft Honestly, survival is relatively fine. Just doesn't have enough representation for blizz to give a shit enough to work out its kinks.
@pbmeetjelly Troll arms warrior named Deer on Queldorei. Took me a year to get to level 30, considering I was 8 years old.
@TheodorosTomara @Wowhead I hear that a lot. Although the class fantasy is fucked around rn, I just think it's a really fun time. I try to make my own thing of it.
@TheodorosTomara @Wowhead Give survival a shot my guy. Best main I've ever mained.
@Gadmiere @trihard7cx7 @SlaveWolfy @garebear517 @Warcraft I have too much hope in people I suppose
@trihard7cx7 @SlaveWolfy @Gadmiere @garebear517 @Warcraft I agree. But raging, or fake raging, on Twitter isnt gonna do a thing about it lol. It doesn't look funny as a meme should, it looks sad.
@trihard7cx7 @SlaveWolfy @Gadmiere @garebear517 @Warcraft Lol when your entire page is complaining, it does seem like you're trying to meme, it makes it seem like you have anger issues
@trihard7cx7 @SlaveWolfy @Gadmiere @garebear517 @Warcraft Real question, why so much anger at blizz? Your entire post history is raging at blizz and riot. The games will never be perfectly balanced. Comes to a point where you have to just accept it and have fun.
@trihard7cx7 @SlaveWolfy @Gadmiere @garebear517 @Warcraft Dude I play hunter idgaf about pallys lol
@Gadmiere @trihard7cx7 @garebear517 @Warcraft He seems very mad that he has to have a challenge sometimes
@RhanunTV @cdew_wow they better not touch my survival hunter unless they increasing something on that bitch
@twrawson Cept you'd spend 8 hours a day chasing them stupid ass cows who decide they want to fuck off past your fences somewhere
@Wowhead Good. Dont touch survival.
@BackwoodsEnginr @ed_k_sf @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So what's the result gonna be? Violence or some shit? You're just gonna have to accept it man. You're brainwashed as hell.
Bunch of hammerheads in this county https://t.co/fAeFPOySm5
@Chuck49806657 @NapkinsJimmy @JSolomon25 @GrahamAllen_1 @realDonaldTrump It's like you want to believe so bad that there's widespread fraud that anything proving it false is fake news and people are brainwashed. Yall are wild.
@ThoughtLeftist @diltiagem @mustachetoilet You are very badass
@RhanunTV @maximum Yea I'm maining survival too cause you can do decent dps and you know you can only go up from here lol. Unless they aoe cap :(
@SolidLemontv @Nirpls @Snutztv Nah shift-q for finishers so they QQ
@TriangleTheHead @bowsedawg @tia_graha @MikealEdd @4Threemj @DopieDopePablo @tyshhawn But it was still racist
@Sanothos @TipsOutBaby Is legendary because such a small amount got to clear vanilla naxx. Even if it will be face rolled, kinda sucks that there is little to no hype because SL launch and nathria/m+ next week.
@JoshHolmez The Hu rly be fire tho
@TrollMonk At least you aren't maining survival this xpac
@TrollMonk But hey, it's a 99 parse :)
@samsullivan15 sup bich
@HankSwitzer @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @NYGovCuomo @JoeBiden you look exactly like the type of hank to believe that
@AditsanAdahy @TuEsBelle_Tee @bluemiiints i dont like you
@RealityGigabyte @derpaderpa70 @Rtdtandjaba @RadRegime @SilentxR @TheM1ghtyBear @dvillella @realDonaldTrump so they're fake news if they aren't praising trump, got it. yall really love the cult of personality
@GrahamAllen_1 @stevenportnoy Lol shut yo dumbass up
@christyluvsla @dan_ferraris @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump You're pretty stupid ya know.
Bro, real talk, Harry Styles can sing like a mafucka
