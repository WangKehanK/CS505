I never long threaded this. TLDR Reserved device MAC addresses + bad srand() seed caused every single shift to break the program.
I guess I never announced this. I wrote a research paper and developed a very cool wireless network security tool last semester. Check it out at https://t.co/caB9wO01wr. I'm really proud of it and am going to continue working on it this semester.

My girlfriend is currently excitedly showing me how cute her Bee Drones are in Slime Rancher. Her other most favorite series is Doom Eternal. I really really really love the range.

I posted this earlier, but I love Maltego. I use it to develop dataflows and maps of people/companies I am pentesting. A really valuable first step in any engagement and the power of transforms are super valuable! 10/10 tool would recommend to anyone in the field #madewithmaltego https://t.co/H6X0g9gwKh

@MaltegoHQ Had a feeling :P, will definitely do so :) Thanks for reaching out!
Maltego is awesome, I use it to map out organizations and people I am researching. Mapping how data flows between device, as well as to &amp; from different sites is super valuable for me too. The transformations help get insight that I wouldn't otherwise find. 10/10 tool https://t.co/t6aUtRKhu0
@pkbeamalpha the Twitter community owes them an apology
