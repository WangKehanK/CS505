@jordanbpeterson CNN continues to show that they are the ones pushing the racist agenda.
@Reds Why does fox sports have to be like this though.
Is Jack’s Pizza better than Digiorno? Maybe.
Big recommendation to go to Green Tree Relief in Reading, MI. I’d never been to a dispensary before and was blown away.
@RussellOkung How unnecessary?
@Frimpon Let’s get this lot chambers out of here.
@RMcElhenney @sixers @dmorey Ocular pat-down
Don’t miss out on frozen White Castle sliders from the grocery store.
@afcnatalie Of course Xhaka with the straight red lol.
We grow at different paces.

Still haven’t built my own box at taco bell yet. It needs to happen before it’s g0ne.
Getting home from a solid grocery store run is a great feeling.
@EstaVivo @Timcast They could work harder OR think smarter but they’d rather chill at the bottom and that’s their choice. I don’t blame them, I’ve been there before.
@AFTVMedia 3-1 ars
@POTUS He’s already slow enough!
@TroopzAFC Leggo ars
@Timcast 😂😂😂🛸
What is better, sausage or bacon? Nobody can answer this because both are better.
@AFTVMedia Still 0 goals
@EduardoHagn You must not think our current players are better? I don’t understand the martinelli obsession. Auba, laca and pepe are miles better than marti.
Waking up at 7am just to be scored on in the first 10 min @Arsenal #why

My downstairs neighbor is always whipping up great smelling meals on sundays. Pork chops cooked in Onion soup 👃🏽🔥 .
@Frimpon Luiz heads that one out!!!
Sometimes I agree with Pizza Hut that no one can out-pizza them. Their buttery crust is great.

New Zealand seems like the place to be.
@casualseinfeld Most lunch breaks
@CharlieDayQuote The gang group dates. When Dennis is talking about his fake rescue dog and Charlie can’t grasp it 😂
@SemperFiArsenal Haland would have hit that running backwards
@Timcast Germ Theory @IanCrossland lol
@sportbible If Saka keeps improving he really has a touch on the ball around and in the box.
Body Armor sports drink is the nectar of the gods.
@TroopzAFC You aren’t the one watching them on the training ground mate.
@Arsenal 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥 yes heccy b is that dude!!!

@FrimponOnline Same 😩 been putting it off for weeks.
Just looked at a tweet from 3 days ago and was super embarrassed 😂 I overlook the most simple of things to get my point across.
@Nati_Sports We need the reds ball boy who fell on the tarp. He can run a field with grace.
@RGIII Who gives a shit
@sportbible He sucks. Have you ever played football in the backyard with friends? That’s not too hard at all.
Mr. Goaty McGoatster
I love Tony Romo as a Super Bowl announcer. This man jizz’s his pants every single play.
@TroopzAFC He is on his Saka shit
@GuyByACactus @SunsSolarPanel WR
Chips Ahoy are for sure better than Oreos.
The Eric Andre show is way too funny.
