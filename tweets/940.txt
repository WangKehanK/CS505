@paaigeann When I spent the night at my family’s houses or at a friends I would cover up the mirror because I didn’t wanna see some scary shit in the mirror behind me
Balled out at work and booked my first vaccination appointment so today’s been pretty cool
This shit has woken me up in the middle of the night the past week https://t.co/FPRWx6a1zz
@FrankieRoth @princess_char_ @what_sey iCow

@DesmonndAndre Bro my mom was making burgers the other day and when I came and looked at the buns there was some from Nov of 2020 and I was like ???
not sure why, but my parents give ZERO fucks about when stuff goes bad... theyre under the impression that if is in the freezer then it will never go bad..
@EasyMoneyJustin Lol 31 and 9 dude, that’s not hate that’s just a lame ass game of football. Only worse games were by the broncos
I wonder how much money people lost today Lolol
THIS game is over 🥱 time to hop on the Xbox. Good night to one of the most boring bowls I’ve ever seen #SuperBowl
One of the most boring Super Bowls I’ve seen honestly 💤 shout out to the buccs tho
KC is botching it and it feels amazing to watch
KC was ass in the first half holy balls
Aaaaaand that’s game. Played a good season and managed to blow it again in the play offs. We’ll make it to the Super Bowl some day but not this season. @BuffaloBills #BillsMafia
It’s definitely not over yet but fuck it’s not looking good.. come on BILLS I know your defense isn’t the best but at least do SOMETHING #BillsMafia
Brady back in the super bowl, this freaking guy
@beeatrriizz Thank you so much! I’m excited
Officially an employed man once again, back in the rat race
@Rashad___B I can def understand that but a lot of the issues with this vaccine are coming from nothing really. And I’m worried that a lot of ppl won’t want to take the vaccine which would stink because that’s the fastest way we can end this shit. 😭
@Rashad___B The time is takes to develop a vaccine isn’t based on the testing they’re doing. It’s based on how much funding they get and since this is a global pandemic they got FAT funding. The technology and knowledge we have now is way better too.
Fuck yeah https://t.co/R3zX6SegKy
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO https://t.co/WGI3O87zHx
Just watched the first two episodes of #WANDAVISION and holy crap! me and the fam loved it. They loved the older type show esthetic and I loved the “something’s not right” vibe
Oooooh dang it’s been 11 years on this app dude where has the time gone
Fried rice is a gift
“Suspended” lol what’s joke. The police that just let those mofos walk into the capital should be in a cell for a long ass time https://t.co/OrHoIIxNkn
@V1NCEE Oooo lolol facts
@V1NCEE Lol fucking relax. We’re not gonna be an easy win if that’s what you’re implying
Big Ben is dog water
35 to 7???? Lolol Steelers fucking suck
Snoooow outside
Saturday’s are for: having an emotional breakdown that starts when you drop your $70 controller on the ground and it breaks so easy you wonder if it was intentionally made from garbage
Chapped lips are so fucking annoying
Getting litty tonight guys prepare for some tipsy tweets
Let’s goooooo!!!! I’m so stoked!! Get lit for me today ppl https://t.co/aX6y9lAcVe
LETS GO BUFFALO BILLS!!! #BillsMafia first play off win in YEARS!!!!
HORSE SHIT HORSE SHIT we should have had a fumble and the game should be over
Joshy my boy you’re a better runner than any of our running backs why do you keep giving it to them
Shout out to the pussies who stormed congress yesterday. You didn’t do shit. In fact you probably fucked yourselves more https://t.co/aigX1yHwP5
On some better news it’s official: Warnock and Ossoff won their seats and now democrats have a majority of the senate https://t.co/aZhnBGRbdp
I’m still so pissed about what happened today at the Capital. Domestic terrorism happened right in front of our eyes because they can’t take a certified loss. Trump is gonna be gone and those fuckers will be on the wrong side of history
@FrankieRoth Lol dude idk something about it seems so fucking cringe to me, no matter how cool you make it look inside it’s still a school bus
Videos that make me unexplainably angry: videos of young affluent white people making a school bus into a house
@ballincollins14 Appreciate it linds!! 🙏🏽
@Sarat0n1n 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Have an interview today and I’m excited, please send good vibes and/or prayers whatever you can send me
LETS GOOOO https://t.co/5FEfY8HoYP
@TallMexicanKid True true I was mostly talking about fantasy
@TallMexicanKid Hope he gets a bag I guess but he’s been a straight disappointment this year
Just watched a video where a guy said "if you have ever once in your life drank a four loko, you're not allowed to worry about whats in the covid vaccine" and i want that to sink in
They took Cam out lol
