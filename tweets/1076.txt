oop woke up to a spoiler of season 8 of the crown rip
GIVE IT A REST K*LE can’t he take a damn break that love island representation is AWFUL and of all the survivors they choose.... 2.... from the.... controversial season especially one directly involved??? production is awful https://t.co/Jl7a1WdZBk
My rankings heading into tomorrow’s finale: 1. Manrika 2. Natalya/Felix 3. Hashu/Syed 4. Pippa+Joey/Tom 5. Andy 6. Shabaz/Alice #TheCircle
I need some strong medication because this is where I’m at too 💀💀💀 #BBCAN9 https://t.co/jlhadCFdd6
Since the double happened, I’ll update my personal rankings: 1. Brey 2. Tychon 3. Tina 4. Jedson 5. Beth 6. Tera 7. Kiefer Really only rooting for Brey at this point. #BBCAN9
Kiefer having the most DRs of the people left irritates my soul 🥴🥴🥴🥴 #BBCAN9 https://t.co/h0HBYqVV37
I wonder if they did HoH tonight or if they’ll wait until tomorrow. #BBCAN9
This is one of the only bright spots with how the season is turning out. SOOO glad we get to see something like this FINALLY, it’s taken far too long. #BBCAN9 https://t.co/RZrWXbuQyw
It’s final 7 and Beth, Tina, and Tychon still have not been nominated yet. #BBCAN9
Breydon being the last of KARB makes me so sad 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 #BBCAN9
It took FIVE swings to get this guy out. He killed the comps, was fun to watch on the feeds, and delivered and contributed to some good fights. Definitely one of the biggest targets and more memorable people this season. I’m sure we’ll see him in the future. #BBCAN9
Watching Beth be so happy casting that vote.... girl fuck off back to the farm #BBCAN9
@BBTeamNorth It turned very steamrollish imo just like BB20 did. Pre-jury was pretty good, then turned sour.
I’m bored.... so bored. Yawn. What a snooze letdown this season turned out to be. #BBCAN9
Double evictions never go the right way sigh #BBCAN9
The WORST part of this double is the fact that K*efer gets Rohan out.... that doesn’t sit right with me at all. #BBCAN9
This is gonna put me in such a shit mood the rest of the night yikes #BBCAN9
If Breydon/Tera/Tina don’t win the next HoH it’s lights out for this season, but it may already be too late given how UGLY this boot order has been. #BBCAN9
IM SOOOOOO SICK OF THE THROUPLE + KIEFER SURVIVING WHEN WILL THIS END #BBCAN9
That horrific spoiler was accurate......... I should’ve never tuned in #Bbcan9
Once Austin went by Victoria’s hands I knew this season was cursed. It’s turning into a Sunsetters steamroll after such a strong start. I won’t watch a steamroll by people I don’t even like. #BBCAN9 https://t.co/53OGRkQPRh
With this HoH outcome this is turning into a Sunsetters steamroll, which is a snooze fest. I’m really about to stop watching after this. #BBCAN9
KIEFER IS THE WORST UGHHHHH ANYONE BUT HIM #BBCAN9
I really fucking cannot stand Kiefer his ego is gonna skyrocket after this HoH win, especially if he gets Rohan out since he’s obsessed with him #BBCAN9
This shit is so boring BREAK UP THE FUCKING THROUPLE #BBCAN9
This is so annoying. Kiefer is playing for 4th and I’m so sick that he’s gonna get Rohan out of all people. #BBCAN9
Kiefer is literally the worse and so unbearable I can’t stand him. This HoH is going to ruin the season. #BBCAN9
FUCK KIEFER #BBCAN9
FUCK THIS SHIT #BBCAN9
Of course my least favorite person is in the lead #BBCAN9
If this Kiefer HoH rumor was true im turning this off #BBCAN9
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK #BBCAN9
CMON BREYDON #BBCAN9
never in my life have I been rooting for men so hard in this game wow #BBCAN9
Doubles never go my way so I’m expecting to lose one of my favorites tonight #BBCAN9
PRAYERS FOR ROHAN AND BREYDON #BBCAN9
Victoria was THE star to come out of this season. Entertaining, played hard constantly, fought to the end... she is what every houseguests should be like. More people like her need to be cast. Much love and respect to Spicy V who I’m sure we’ll see in a future season. #BBCAN9
I feel like tonight determines the rest of the season. If the Throuple isn’t broken up tonight... it’s very likely they steamroll the rest of the game. #BBCAN9
Of course the one week where they could fill a full hour of campaigning and gameplay and fights they have to squeeze things into 15 minutes #BBCAN9
Doubles give me this weird pit in my stomach like nothing else... I swear the nerves are like no other nerves I feel #BBCAN9
Ah yes, BBCAN and their dramatic openings #BBCAN9
This fucker better not block Manrika #TheCircle
@mundaneparade unfortunately Bear is trash who had sex with underage girls and also did revenge porn so we will indeed be keeping Fessy
@ovidonato @BbcanHav3not because Tina had a brain fart yesterday and somehow Tera got the brain cells she lost
@sarahthoughts3 im going back to Bing!
it’s like a national holiday for big brother fans when double eviction day rolls around #BBCAN9
Trishelle always provides the drama she needs to come back next season. Better than all the current challenge regular girlies in the drama department for sure #TheChallengeAllStars
@tracieTweetsTv I was shocked listening to the TNT convo where basically Tera got everything right and Tina got it all wrong... like an alternate universe. Ro/Brey previously said they would vote for Ty to win over anyone else so I’m assuming that would be their double target.
I love Vic’s energy and how amazing she is for team fun feeds and the way she plays hardcore all the time but........ this is what she gets for going after Austin and Breydon last week instead of splitting up the Throuple 🤷🏼‍♂️ #BBCAN9
*Ro/Brey may target Jed over Ty but I distinctly remember them both saying Ty would have their vote over any of the trio, so I’m assuming Ty would be their target if they won in the double.
imo if Tina wins she’ll have her mind changed and just take the big shot by nominating the bros outright because she’ll see if she puts up Brey or Ro and they’re a final nom they’ll go home #BBCAN9 https://t.co/NLRZsyDLZy
So after today’s events, here’s the current DE plans:  Jed/Ty/Kiefer: Ro/Brey noms, Ro target, Tera rep nom  Ro/Brey: Jed/Ty noms, Ty target, Kiefer renom  Tera: Jed/Ty noms, Jed target, Beth renom  Tina: Ro/Brey noms, Jed BD target, Jed rep nom  #BBCAN9
If Kiefer actually does that and noms were to stay the same.... Tina/Tera/Brey could vote out Jed. #BBCAN9 https://t.co/fbHg736dcY
So based off of what people have been saying they’d do... Rohan/Brey- Jed/Ty, Kiefer renom Tera- Jed/Ty, Beth renom Tina- Brey/Ro, Jed BD renom Kiefer- Brey/Ro, Tera? renom Jed/Ty- Tera/Tina, Ro BD renom *Kiefer/Ty have discussed doing Jed/Tera noms to backdoor Ro. #BBCAN9
This is so stupid. If Ro or Brey are up on that block, 3 of Jed/Ty/Beth/Kiefer will vote them out against whoever else is up. #BBCAN9 https://t.co/dv20gbBioh
I’m laughing Kyle deadass called Fessy weak and argued with him all season long only to get his ass rocked by him in a physical elim LMAOOO #TheChallenge36
This basically confirms to me that she’d put up the boys initially and then if a renom was needed it could get tricky for her. I’d expect either Beth or Brey go up as a pawn (but Brey would likely go home if she does this). #BBCAN9 https://t.co/lTh5Vxl8Pk
I think that was my favorite episode of the season so far. #BBCAN9
Beth, Tina, and Tychon are the only people left who have yet to be nominated. #BBCAN9
Nobody asked for this sympathetic Tera edit. Fuck that. #BBCAN9
My favorite ❤️❤️❤️ #BBCAN9 https://t.co/KsiKzeWlfx
Brey and Ro being the only one to complete the comp 💓💓💓 #BBCAN9
Victoria is a PERFECT host for a comp. #BBCAN9
I will never not vote for Rohan because my petty ass loves just sticking it to Kiefer that we love who he hates. #BBCAN9 https://t.co/ZA1NqbuvD2
I will never get over how stupid and unfair this rule is that the HoH cannot compete in Veto. #BBCAN9
LMAOOO THEY SHOWED KIEFER MAD AF THAT ROHAN WON A FAN VOTE #BBCAN9
I love seeing Rohan win fan votes because I know how mad it makes Kiefer. #Bbcan9
This showmance segment is CRINGEEEEE #BBCAN9
They’re being VERY generous with Beth’s edit tonight. They’re making it look like she was never wavering or being swayed by the boys, but she waited so long to put her foot down. #BBCAN9
Tina &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kiefer #BBCAN9
Kiefer’s obsession with Rohan is so gross and it’s so annoying. His attitude is unbearable to watch on the feeds and on the show #BBCAN9
Teranoia LMAOOOOO it’s so accurate #BBCAN9
LOVEEEE THIS SO MUCH #TheCircle https://t.co/aekvnDXxnx
My faves 🥺🥺🥺 https://t.co/EUnP7TQ2gX
@mundaneparade it’s cathartic
the assignment didn’t understand her.... she’s too powerful for the assignment your honor https://t.co/5KhFLJ8Ih6
20 episodes for this season of the challenge is so ridiculous, especially when they’re 90 minutes each 😴 https://t.co/cWY6Bxkl8w
HE LOOKS...... see children, this is what happens to racist people 😌😌😌 https://t.co/uPcxgFhM9Z
@superTV247 it better be her blocked... I’ll rage if it’s Felix she’ll either visit Felix or Syed I can’t really figure out which one she’d rather see
The obvious blocking here is Dot. Manrika won’t give up Felix. Syed won’t give up Andy. #TheCircle
It’s gotta be Dot or Andy going here.... we simply need Felix and Manrika to meet at the final dinner and Syed is far too important to let go plus it’d be interesting to see everyone’s reactions to him being a catfish #TheCircle
really poor ratings compared to the last 3 seasons..... I think part of the issue is poor pre-promotion, only announcing the season 2 weeks before it premiered and because of covid most of the shows bbcan is up against is all new compared to usually having some reruns #BBCAN9 https://t.co/xbRCLmm3C2
Loveeeee a good old fashioned fight #BBCAN9 https://t.co/nRYt8gMMwa
