@RJSzczerba The first one would be Steak and Pickles and the second would be Dessert.
@thesarahkelly What men don’t realize is that women are competitive. We also control most of the household spending. It’s really stupid how underfunded women’s sports is, and how much money is left on the table. These teams are being fiscally irresponsible.
@lemonsand @annehelen @amandamull WTF why would anyone do the 2 reno’s you showed in that blog. I’d kill for those architectural details.
@dshiao @BerrakBiz This. 100%
@dunkhippo33 My favorite is gardening. https://t.co/ljkcpBtgTh
@CarlyPildis @PODS Credit card chargeback.
@baekdal This guy will be a douche as a neighbor. Run away. https://t.co/z8QyCvZYJ2
Hunter S. Thompson is rolling over in his grave.
@ProductHunt You’re a feature. (Not a product)
@the_bonnfire @thesarahkelly When it comes to the Middle East, Reuters is a tabloid
@SamRo https://t.co/ghCp219Lzn
@the_bonnfire @thesarahkelly Odd. According to the WSJ breaking news it’s free? https://t.co/vrE73hRodk
@thesarahkelly Go for a walk.
@JasonRBradwell Oh that’s bad.
@JasonRBradwell Is he serious or taking the piss on agencies?
@ProfFeynman @dianekovacs My son gets 100%, then points off for not showing his work the right way. I get that they want to know that he knows how to do the work, but he shows enough - they know he’s doing the work &amp; gets it. No business will micromanage that closely as long as the answer is correct.
@gannonbreslin And yet, it’s so fitting.
@jewlicious Shuki
This shouldn’t be a thing. https://t.co/SSK0tRFfuz
@ZABLACKWOLF @FBI That’s one of the best movies ever.
@thesarahkelly I don’t mind the painted brick, I do kind of mind the painted stone. Is that weird?
#tbt Me. Young. https://t.co/6IJNd8lTGp
@blach I’ve noticed it more lately. A few months ago it would  the same blessed playlist. Which got boring real fast.
Apple Music is now playing better stuff when I choose a song at random than Spotify.
@jowyang The new tax plan by Biden will destroy the middle class Californian. The cost of living out here doesn’t equate with the standard/cost of living in the rest of the US.

@HenMazzig My mother in law make THE BEST kubbe.
@DanielleMorrill Kids need their friends and community. Stability is crucial, and moving all the time kills that. It would be like a military kid (which is notoriously hard), but worse - no community.
@UrbanOutfitters your site is down https://t.co/TRmqwB6caS
@BillGRinehart Pics or it didn’t happen.
@thesarahkelly Daria was the best

@ezrabutler He was an emotional f#ckwit and you’re better off without him.
@tejarebernik @dejidde @SLG_UG @AlettaJacobsSPH CONGRATS!   I DM’d
Thank you @Nick_CMO ! https://t.co/auwN6KlyhM
@InTheBleachers @thesarahkelly This.
This is insane.  https://t.co/bDj834xFHB
@aarthir @stbaasch @tonyhawk @sriramk @stevesi @pdavison @garrytan @GoodTimeShowCH 1 female speaker? 🤷🏻‍♀️
@JasonRBradwell Oh wait. They called and want to be fed? Risotto. Tomato risotto. I have homemade soup stock in the freezer so that makes it super easy.
@JasonRBradwell Depends. Probably a roasted halibut with a wine butter caper shallot sauce with steamed veggies and salad.
@jasondmckay @JessicaGottlieb @Hyatt OMFG, and it’s not even subtle. 🤦🏻‍♀️
@JessicaGottlieb @Hyatt I definitely missed something.
@robinwauters @ediggs @pawell Hey @aishacarif - you should talk to Robin.
@itsannahello You’re not part of that statistic.
@jesslynnrose Cooking! Planting seedlings. Puzzles. Reorganizing.
@tibo_maker Could be.
@tibo_maker Honestly, still odd.
@tibo_maker That’s an odd choice from all my tweets over the years. What’s the definition of “best”?
@tibo_maker 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi!
You know what? I’m quite fine with our virus being in the range of the rest of them. https://t.co/sszAaUBTpi
Fantastic. Just what we needed. 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/JanYLFIWmN
@ScottHolleran @appodlachia She’s not fun though. She’s heavy. It would be serious and egomaniacal with too much pontification.   Gah. No.   Think Dorothy Parker or Oscar Wilde.   Truman Capote. George Carlin.   Think fun.
@JoshuaConkel @appodlachia I was just about to answer that, and I looked down and there it was.  She really would.
@xalihalabi Turkish Air is one of my favorite airlines. They really always go above and beyond.
@xalihalabi I’ll be honest - I don’t know. But as I’m also Israeli, I figure it’s better to be cautious 🤷🏻‍♀️
@xalihalabi I’m hoping the politics calms down a bit more first as well.
@xalihalabi I’m really hope I get to go one day. I loved Antalya.
@eliesheva Just to watch my slow descent into madness?
@eliesheva No. But offer me a 100k and I only have to keep them on for a year and we have a deal.
