@nbishy2k @isaac__barrow @Orioles Fernando Tatis Jr sounds and looks very similar to Dustin Pedroia too 👀
@isaac__barrow @Orioles As a Red Sox fan, I can confirm. Will be putting in my application to become a Padres fan shortly
Hot take: the Orioles are secretly the best team in baseball and this absolutely does not reflect the Red Sox so far. Thoughts? @Jared_Carrabis @Steve_Perrault
@Steve_Perrault Verdugo!
@JacksonHughes33 This is a lie and you know It. Such a low blow dude. Way to insult the actual #1 team (oh yeah, and they won their conference btw). UNT would mop the floor with ACU

@ReaganHuggins12 Reagan, this didn’t age well 😂
@kyle_schmidt18 Dude they finally finished I-35 in Temple after like 6 years. You and I would never see the completion of this in Texas 😂
@ReaganHuggins12 How much?
This dude really just walked to the plate and hit a NUKE in his first spring training at bat. Tampa really doesn’t miss with prospects often, huh? https://t.co/qDoWehjFBL
@Theuke97 They voted him in. Cancel culture doesn’t apply to him 🤷🏻‍♂️
@BaseballBrit I’ve visited both states on hiking vacations and I pick Arizona hands down. Weather is way better plus I can go see more games because everything is so close. And my favorite team plays in the Grapefruit League
@JacubThulean @iJordanMoore @MLBTheShow Nah they got rid of it a few years ago
@Topps George Springer is about to tear it up in Toronto this year 👀
@iJordanMoore I agree with a lot of your takes but not this one 😂😅 Trevor at 2!? Lance at 8!? Kellen Mond in the top 10!? Not every take has to be a hot take Jordan 😉😂
@ToiletPkay @Pokemon If we get those remakes I’m buying a switch
@iJordanMoore @MLBTheShow Screw that! Bring back online franchise mode!!! As much as I hate madden, it’s the only game with a decent online franchise
@iJordanMoore He took It cuz that’s where he wants to be. Some dudes are about the team and taking 10 mil less a year can buy a championship or two with the right signings 🤷🏻‍♂️
@Topps Dodgers beat the White Sox in 5 games 👀
@GoertzSarah #gandalf2024
:( https://t.co/rKiqqVtSx2
@iJordanMoore If we draft Kellen Mond I’m becoming a bengals fan
@BoomS4C Name another NBA player who went to 10 championships. Kareem? Bill Russell? Now do It to NFL players. Dude has as many rings as the Steelers (who have the most). Bron is probably the most talented hooper of all time. But what Brady has done in the NFL is a different level
@Mayagarza21 Ones that Benny catch like this 😉 https://t.co/WCkmujJrpE
@Milkynades Group chat if it’s with the boys, group message if it’s work related
@ReaganHuggins12 All I see is a dude who dropped a national championship against Tech 🤷🏻‍♂️
@cjromero11 We’ll trade you Nick Folk for Tucker. He looks broken
Y’all go check out my boy for a super entertaining stream 👀 https://t.co/oznrhFS60Y
@Cut4 Aaron Fucking Boone
@Activision fix your game. Tired of kids with zero skill spamming the dmr every game
@colon_austin This boy goin to jail
@colon_austin Both sandhill and whooping cranes are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918. This law strictly prohibits the capture, killing, or possession of sandhill and whooping cranes without proper permits.
Please become true https://t.co/2pT9C9uIHH
@Jared_Carrabis How do you not vote for Todd Helton?
@Mayagarza21 We don’t want him 🤷🏻‍♂️
@kyle_schmidt18 @DSmitka10 That we can agree on 😂😂
@kyle_schmidt18 @DSmitka10 Key words: Under Saban. Not many Saban assistants have been good on their own
@kyle_schmidt18 @DSmitka10 Why do you like that hire? Dude was a garbage fire at USC. Can we all just say we miss Mac Brown :(
@p2jsportscards @Topps @brandon1farrand
@Mayagarza21 Devonta Smith 100%
@GoertzSarah *our boy
@TonyDungy it’s what place he comes in on your list, not how many rings he has https://t.co/CQJYfLCN2l
@iJordanMoore Jordan, we can put YOU in pads and you’d be better than Trent Richardson
@Mayagarza21 I see the future quarterback of the New England Patriots and some guy with a dad bod wearing #10
@1234Tedman @iJordanMoore Nice grammar btw, kid
@1234Tedman @iJordanMoore Think ESPN is gonna hire you to protect all their tweets from being stolen for calling someone out?
@1234Tedman @iJordanMoore Also, please tell me YOUR top 5 rookies and I guarantee I’ll find you “stealing someone else’s list”.
@1234Tedman @iJordanMoore Then unfollow him? Do you get this mad at Bleacher Report or Bartstool for posting the same exact things ESPN does?
@iJordanMoore nO u CoPiEd HiM https://t.co/qUgjee8jE8
@1234Tedman @iJordanMoore @LedyardNFLDraft Maybe, hypothetically, just maybe, these are indeed the best 5 rookies this season? Just a thought though
@Topps Run Rudolph Run (Lemmy’s cover of It, of course)
@RunnTDC @iJordanMoore Pretty sure he just kept every team at the seeds they’re currently at, but go off, king 👑
@Topps https://t.co/nbVUIfHmOa
@ReaganHuggins12 Being a Pats fan in Texas is just as bad 😢
@MommaThatsQuis @Patriots It’s either him or Hoyer 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
@MommaThatsQuis @Patriots SIGN FITZBEARD!!!
@MommaThatsQuis @Patriots I think he needs to sit for a year and learn but like. Who’s gonna mentor him?
Am I the only one NOT having any issues with Cyberpunk 2077 on ps4?
@Topps Diehard!!!
@kickrocksjay @MommaThatsQuis Honorable mention? That would be #1 on my Spotify wrapped this year 💀😂
@StoolGametime Champions of Norrath, anyone? 👀
I’ve been saying this for YEARS!!!! https://t.co/Hm5ssbqCce

@noah_football12 100% Bucks are all in but if Giannis is smart, he’ll realize they’re gonna have NOTHING in the draft for a few years and dip
@noah_football12 100%!!!!
@noah_football12 Okay I’m just now seeing that. 3 firsts is a little steep IMO 😂
@noah_football12 The Bruce Brown Blockbuster wasn’t good enough for you?
@BradyyNFL The only Sony we talk about in this house is @PlayStation now
Don’t tell my mom I’m RT’ing this https://t.co/ya2wyUPMBU
@colon_austin My bad G
@colon_austin Took Hinch less and he was the ringleader of the whole thing
@colon_austin Why you laughin’?

@theannikaj I figured most of those votes were from Milwaukee anyways. I know GA is still really close and Biden has really narrowed the gap in PA due to these bigger cities counting their mail ins later than other states.
@theannikaj Thank you! It just didn’t happen (or get covered) of It happening in other states. With this being such an important battleground state, It just amplified everyone’s reaction to It.
@theannikaj How do you explain the massive dump of Biden votes though? Yes I do know that a vast majority of mail in ballots will be Dem, however every single one of 140k or whatever the number was? HIGHLY unlikely
@theannikaj Yes this has been proven false a few hours after I had posted this. Thank you for the link!
So you mean to tell me that 140k votes just... turned up in Wisconsin. All of them for Biden. I’m also now seeing that there are MORE BALLOTS SENT IN WISCONSIN THAN REGISTERED VOTERS. Please open your eyes people to this corruption. The MSM is not your friend
Blue sus
So you mean to tell me the three biggest cities in the three biggest battleground states are holding votes until tomorrow? 🤔
