orange spacedrink is a drag queen with a barbarella gimmick
this chopped episode calling tang “orange space drink” ....
@celebritykin hes a real king for this
@balzabul oh No
i say dumb bullshit online AND with my real human mouth, regularly
i’m not anti cheese ideologically (just enzymologically lol) but it inherently has the capacity to be More Gross than strange face meats
“head cheese” is a really gross word for something, like, at least comparatively, not that gross
@angremlin @Academ_y1 wow this reply is making me nostalgic for when i used to bitch about writing college papers on twitter
i started going by a new name like *does math* four years? before i started going by a new gender LMFAOOOO
while i don’t remember lifelong malcontent with gender (just a struggle with being able to reproduce it) i do remember a lifelong malcontent with my given name, so like, what kinda dysphoria is that
a phenomenon i’m glad did not follow from tumblr to twitter is “fanart for posts” although it is my favorite source of small time grifts
woke up at 5 am bc mildred was trying to get me to feed her and my first thought was “klein bottle... i wonder if a klein bong is a thing” and it is
ok cool just wanted to check https://t.co/L4jTHszjk3
@batheandhunt blessedly what is more flexible is ones own desires... which is not to say push yourself to accept things you’re dissatisfied with, because that’s stressful and arduous, but be open to the probability that how you feel right now is not inevitable or permanent
@bloodsuckerhead WTF INDEED!!!!!! i was scrolling thru the pasta wikipedia like “what the hell? what the hell?”
@ophiocordiceps one sec https://t.co/AwysST0M2c
my brain is at the frequency where i’m like “do the english have a native pasta or noodle and if no why not” at my roommate and she just stares bewilderedly at me
@celebritykin i always forget abt his silly mustache

oooooo i’m wigglin. cullen hobacks interview on QAA... it’s elucidating. a very good episode with good conversations.
@ophiocordiceps i think there’s a 30% chance it rules which isn’t nothing
@ophiocordiceps IM YELLING... LMAO... if you move into a studio here it will 100% be haunted. like i’m just imagining a lil attic or cellar space that several people were murdered in in 1891
@celebritykin cats DOES slap
i could make this clearer but i won’t
most hot takes seem to me like people doing astrology but not. a lateral move from astrology to having heavily quote tweeted opinions online.
@granemlin oh shit
emily: simbas on your nightstand me: so he is https://t.co/aBaIGOK8JT

*writing a personal bio* blair kitsch is a twin cities based graphic designer and writer. he is ready to commit fucking arson.
nothing makes me more immediately evil than when i try to build a website for myself again.
@celebritykin OH NO KING
@celebritykin edit it to say fuck
i feel like 3d animation didn’t need to progress beyond shrek quality. that’s good enough
@nuditea THANK YOU SATAH i can always count on you. for a variety of things but also the fact that while we are not always the Same vibe we are very frequently on Deeply Complementary Vibes. idk i love u LOL

@Fearbaiting @hindsightee *pick. clarifying bc the two have significantly different meanings. cool pic too tho
@Fearbaiting @hindsightee NO QUESTIONS THIS IS JUST A COOL PIC LOL i’m excited to hear what y’all have to say!!!!
i don’t think being difficult to contact is a cool sexy valuable trait but it is what i need right now in life so i will be romanticizing it. thank you.
this i think is what they call “self care”
if you dm me and i don’t respond it’s bc i tried to formulate the time commitment of having a conversation, got very overwhelmed, panicked, and turned notifications off for that app
eight years. https://t.co/pAHiyaWCWd
i remember hearing someone say “the suez canal thing was good bc it’s impossible to spread misinfo abt bc it’s so simple” when the first time it ended up on my radar is hearing that qanon ppl were cooking up something abt like children being trafficked on it or w/e
@BillbudsPod @JohnnyInBriefs @JPsoFLY you better actually do this
my most problematic trait is that i like minimalist-but-inscrutable graphic design so much
the whole “thank god my leftism is less cringe than those leftists” is so fuckin funny. like either yes you are cringe, leftism is cringe, too bad it’s still a moral obligation, or your politics are fuckin bad dude
if i never see another nominal lefty post a soyboy/soyface meme again it’ll be too soon. i’m sorry to break it to you but you’re the soyboy, which is not in and of itself a read but posting it does make you a chump which is a read. thanks for your time
@SunhatZhenya god i love . i just love this. wtf
@SunhatZhenya WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS
thinking abt how jack pasobiec looks like the exact mean if you averaged out the faces of shapiro kirk and wohl. sometimes the universe just aligns how it should https://t.co/sVMEEAiXgj
tdov. i’m hot you’re going to have to take my word for it
@nesterists like this was already unhinged but so much is put in context if this is their understanding of “vice” like.,...... did the temperance movement ever leave for you........... LMAO
@nesterists holy fucking shit
@puppymoth 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
@nuditea I THINK... even with all the nostalgia attached to it (i hope we get the chance to see a show together again 😭😭😭) ... i really does all the things i love abt alopecia ESP in terms of production and mixing just like.... better. which tbh is always a fun thing to have
i think.... aokohio is gonna usurp alopecia as my favorite WHY? albums......... perhaps................. much to consider
tenderqueers aren’t real queens just say white fragility
