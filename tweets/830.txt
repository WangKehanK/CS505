Our Uber driver was honestly the best. She wished my friend and I “rich, handsome, respectful men”...and yes. Me too sis

@poojjahh 😂😂 I haven’t watched yet but I can’t  wait !
I actually got a rush from discussing  about FURNITURE.  She even pulled out the bed portion of the couch so I could “test it out”...and I did 😭. “Ooo yeah this is comfy. My guests would appreciate this”...Oh I’m grown af now
How I know I’m out here doing the adult thing: 1: had a wine date with my neighbor that I actually committed to . 2. A good portion of the convo when I first got there was on my admiration of how “zen” &amp; inviting her place was and her furniture buys

@bameron_3 Thanks Cam 🤗😄
@Rene_Kamikaze_2 😄😂
Two weeks ago I received an amazing job offer and secured my living space. Next week I move into my beautiful, new place with an amazing roommate and I start a career doing the work I love. Post grad life had its trials but I am collecting all of my blessings. Won’t He do it ❤️
Didn’t realize how monumental that moment was for me until after I left his shop. That’s the first time I have said my title out loud. I’m not an “interning” therapist. I’m a clinical therapist. Definitely in my feels 😭
I was getting the links on my watch adjusted and the guy tells me that I have a very soothing voice. He then asks if I’m in LA pursuing a singing  career. I said I no then told him I’m  a clinical therapist. Which, honestly, my “soothing voice” works in my favor with clients.
@bameron_3 Netflix really needs to put you on their payroll
