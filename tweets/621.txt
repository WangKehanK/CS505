Why do strangers make more eye contact with my stomach than with my face?? Fucking RUDE. Fastest way to piss me off y’all
I hate that I have to make a living for myself?? I don’t even want to be here and people expect me to do the best I can? Definitely not the mood.
Let’s *not* talk about diets. Anything else please but why do we always gotta y’all about diets? Come on.
Sometimes I think of @muyskerm and I smile. He’s a good man.    BUT I SWEAR IF HE TURNS OUT TO BE PROBLEMATIC IMA BEAT ASS

@gentleryn_ Fuck your dad. I don’t know much about him but he’s a horrible person. You can have my dad. He’s good with pronouns and actually likes spending time with his kids and family. Fuck your dad man.
Fuck Joe Biden. https://t.co/wbBa4Od883
@phonecallsat3am I WANT THESE SHOES WHERE CAN I GET?!
If you are a father and you act put-out when you’re doing things with your family, just fucking leave. No one has time for your shitty attitude and your shitty personality. Fucking men being assholes.

@ThePigeonWizard @mckenziewilkes @tired_druid Nooooooooo 🥺😂
Sometimes when I’m sad I get reminded of @dungeonsdice and the players and the DM and I’m not sad anymore.
@akikokenzo MAYA AND MIGUEL
If im@ever sad on here, remind me that I have one of the DDEN players as a friend on switch.
@usedtobedenny What’s the right account? Can I follow it??
@celebheights1 Before she dyed her hair tho
That being said I can crush on @egoraptor and not feel bad other than the fact he has a wife... whom I also crush on. My brain needs to chill.
Dan Avidan is lovely but says fatphobic things sometimes and it makes me really sad but then I see shit he puts out and my brain says 😍🥰😘💖🌸✨😫 I hate myself for that. No self respect smh #GameGrumps

@PICKMIXGAMER @Apocalypto_12 @Jack_Septic_Eye I did mean his mom. You definitely could have worded it differently I stead of talking to him like he doesn’t know. Not that he will see any of these tweets but yeah.
@clakearts @markiplier The boobs definitely have to be bigger 😂😂😂
@Moyoskii Not me. My tiddies too saggy tf
@PICKMIXGAMER @Apocalypto_12 @Jack_Septic_Eye Idk if you know or not but Tyler has had loss of his own. You kinda look stupid commenting this under his tweet.
Why does everyone want tall skinny black guys to play basketball? Like all the tall skinny black guys I know make video games or movies or some nerdy shit. Let the stereotype DIE
@phonecallsat3am Oof be still my heart ♥️💛💖💝
@phonecallsat3am You’re gorgeous
@usedtobedenny Lemme hold you tho

@Hollaaaay This makes me fucking rage
3 Peens in a Pod. Bob (muskern) talking about body positivity. My bitch ass, I just can’t. He put it perfectly. I wish I could tell everyone about it but my dumb ass. I have no idea what episode this is, I’m just watching it on twitch. It just made me feel better I guess?
