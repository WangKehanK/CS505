This part. Don’t allow your children into adult spaces if you don’t want them to be exposed to adult content. 🥴 that’s on you love, not the artist making the music. https://t.co/TZSgfwelWX
I’m under too much stress in my life to only be 22 years old 🥴
@tayrenza Mine is 2 days after your bday 🎉
@humansrightspls That part
I’m so tired of living in Alabama and having to pretend to be cis everyday, but these backwoods republicans are TERRIFYING. I’m seeing too many similarities between here and Vernon and I think that’s my cue to go.
I swear if one more person asks me if my bosses are my parents my brain is going to explode. Y’all… I don’t even look remotely Hispanic. I’m yt with a literal dash of Native American.  How I get mistaken for anything more than yt is beyond me 🤣
If y’all see me in my feelings today just know I’m okay, but don’t ask me how I’m feeling. I will cry. https://t.co/P23vC18vq8
I love when my mom sends me pictures of my bills from school like I make enough money to fully support myself AND pay off every little thing I owe. We love slipping deeper and deeper into debt 🥴 to the tune of about 15K I think now L M A OOOOOO I hate it here
@wrenby99 I... 🤣
@how_u_livin @tribranchvo ^this
Logged into Facebook and 1st thing I see is someone from good ole Vernon claiming Biden didn’t win fairly and he isn’t president-elect... logged off so quick. It ain’t worth it tonight ☠️🤣
A million thoughts in my head and I’m struggling to make sense of anything. Starting 2021 in a big ball of confusion 🥴
This part. I can have a beard if I want, gender is fake luv 😘 https://t.co/TIMS2Rc7Fu

Bringing this back because it’s still relevant https://t.co/S2SvtPjje9
Please go run this queen back up to what she deserves https://t.co/oNd2uZ5AUl
@motato_salad Sure! I’ll be getting off around 9:30, peters making us dinner but you’re welcome to come hang and see all the pets
@houseofillium I’m absolutely howling 🤣
Photo dump of my Spotify wrapped, top 0.05% of Megan listeners, streamed Lawd Jesus by @CupcakKe_rapper before it hit 50,000 streams, and streamed the hell out of Rain on me to and from work 🤣 also my #4 artist is solely because I have to play music at work 😅 https://t.co/qkhfZ2Cwcf
@yudlers It’s okay we been knew he’s ugly
@yudlers Like this fucker? https://t.co/4n3aDIg8ng
I just want to scream at the top of my lungs, I’m tired of getting fucked over and short handed in every single aspect of my life. Soooooooo fucking tired.
I needed to hear this today https://t.co/IGbx9t3KxS
SCREECHING https://t.co/o2E27JN03W
This man really said 👁👄👁 https://t.co/mMHEZcT2zj
S/o to the guys who text me once a month just to call me babe and get on my nerves 🥴
Literally my 2nd table of the day and they’re being complete assholes 🥴
Here I go again pushing everyone who might possibly give a shit about me away, way to go me.
It’s going to be a long ass weekend...
@Wendys what is the point of being able to order ahead if the app cannot tell you the store you’re ordering from is out of what you want? Just wasted 20, almost 30 minutes in the drive thru to be told they were out of grilled chicken once I got to the window. Nonsense.
Wish I could do something right in at least one part of my life 🥴
@SouthernHomo On an indefinite hiatus from college, in one of the healthiest relationships in my life and putting things in the works to starting my own business. The past few years have been tough but I’m a trooper.
Should I quit my job???  I can literally never do anything right and I’m tired of dealing with the bull shit.
@yudlers I’m howling 🤣
@yudlers https://t.co/52fdJHXqdA
@yudlers Relatable
Really wish my insurance would go into effect so I can get this useless organ out of my body. I’m so fucking tired of feeling like shit and having to grin and bear it.
I’m always worried about shit that literally has nothing to do with me and that the anxieTEA sis.
Boomers be like: “oh can I get a #18”  Me: *brings them exactly what they ordered* Boomer: “this isn’t what I wanted I told you I wanted the #16” Me: “okay I’m sorry let me fix that for you”  Boomer: “no, it’s fine. I’ll just eat this”   *no tip in sight*
Customers really be like, “omg you’re the best server we’ve ever had.” And still only leave you $2 🥴 I hate y’all.
Holy shit I need a better job
I love when people ask what an acronym means like they couldn’t google it in half the time it takes me to type out and explain it.
