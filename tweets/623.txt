"Fulfilling the requirements of a job for which there is no precise standard, unless you consider second fiddle a job description, Philip navigated the most challenging of corporate dress codes for more than 65 years."   Perfect @GuyTrebay  https://t.co/71LxrkIz58
Prince Philip was the career woman's ideal husband, his commitment was not merely to "modern monarchy," writes Tina Brown, but also to "modern matrimony."  https://t.co/rysSjlVq6U
@mamalizzie @tariro You would never accept a deadline coming before a key family discussion like this. You know Tariro‚Äôs mom‚Äôs pain!!
@tariro sorry, but I'm with mom on this one

"When this tall, handsome prince married the young crown princess, Elizabeth, (he at 26, she at 21)  on Nov. 20, 1947, a battered Britain was still recovering from World War II, the sun had all but set on its empire." https://t.co/NAnvSGNn3p
Married 73 years. Longer than many people live. RIP https://t.co/VXLhxrd9uj

It‚Äôs not easy to reduce disobedience of the laws of physics to 280 characters. https://t.co/H9cClgbalz
@klyon19 Lol, exactly!
@DeniseSchipani It really is. The matter in my brain is shifting trying to make sense of it all

@heyitsfranklin2 My new work BFF has great style.
Hair stylists now face the challenge of fixing the havoc you have wrought on yourself.   "The damage has been done. I am a good barber but I‚Äôm not a magician.‚Äù  Snip snip, indeed.  Love this piece from @RachelEnsignWSJ! https://t.co/HMzkSOPiUZ

@WelchCorgiLover There can be no other take-away
@Wzzy the best!
@taraabrahams It holds up!!
@EvelynYang @AndrewYang Congratulations, Evelyn!!
@katiebart Thank you!! Added to the thread!
It also got the WSJ ahed treatment, with the perfect WSJ line: ‚ÄúThe accidental CC, a staple of office email culture for decades‚Äù https://t.co/a59zOvGOzH
Imagine the angst of the New Yorker copy editor in having to let ‚ÄúZoe‚Äù appear without a diaeresis because the emailer that the story quotes didn‚Äôt use one. (Also, ‚Äúshoot your shot‚Äù is √ºtter perfection.) https://t.co/XptQ7uuhzO
Imagine your worst accidental reply all ending up in the New Yorker. https://t.co/Os0Tc3jRLp

@AdamTrot Yep and the latter.

@AlPaul I think it helps them keep track of what‚Äôs happening on the bigger screen as they also stare at the one in their hand.
Anyone know what the movie is?
@AdamTrot Yes! Good point.
My kids insist that we watch movies with captions on and it makes every moment a meme. https://t.co/8MJ3OIjhzl
@danieljweiner They‚Äôre just little adages, nothing famous or that profound. But I love newsprint, on-brand for me!
@MickiMaynard Thank you!
One of the best reasons to bring your kid to Home Depot with you is for them to tell you you‚Äôre being ‚Äúa little bit Karen‚Äù when you‚Äôre asking detailed questions about paint.
The man who gave me my shot is a CVS pharmacist who, early on, led teams of vaccinators through nursing homes in Rockland County. For residents on the ground level, family would gather outside their windows to celebrate as they watched their loved one get the jab‚ù§Ô∏èüíâ
@mandaclay There is never not a story. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@OlympiaChewbaca It‚Äôs scrappy and it doesn‚Äôt give up.

@erinoverbey @rachsyme As a cub reporter, I was drawn in by gossipy unnamed sources + am ashamed of this piece. I wanted to reflect society's jealousy/racism/classism but failed. It's a reason I'm loathe to let ppl talk off record, a learning experience at someone else's expense https://t.co/V5Q2ZqmVRl

@tomgara Sorry it‚Äôs taking so long, we‚Äôre all just really really baked
@ssdai Yours is definitely better
@susanorlean It was the most impactful TV experience of the pandemic for us. We called it ‚Äúbejeebers‚Äù because I kept saying it was scaring the bejeebers out of me
@JeffGrocottNYC @brooksbarnesNYT They had said they were done, finished, had left it all behind. But then Disney stuck the hot dog in the pickle and fried it. How could they turn away? This would be the big one. They one they always dreamed about. The one that would let them retire rich. The last big score.
@ShawnMcCreesh Don Johnson‚Äôs a big, expensive star
@greenfieldmj @brooksbarnesNYT if spicy mustard is wrong, I don't wanna be right
The NFL hasn't revealed the findings of its investigation into the harassment of female employees of the Washington Football Team.  But Snyder's fellow team owners have spoken by letting him buy out his minority partners: Dan's their man. @el_belson  https://t.co/QehUe6q8D1
@tomgara @eringriffith @sapna Nope (signed, Michigan girl)
@tomgara Very surprised BK added more carbs to its logo

@megstalter We don't pay.
Leave it to a Real Housewife to (allegedly) commit a brand-burnishing crime. https://t.co/aPtZu3tc26
@StillHereBugger Everything was fully booked last night and then very early this AM when I tried, there was some availability.
@jamesrhine That is wonderful news.
@sternbergh Hahaha, that is a great idea!
The rule that the Washington Post just reversed would preclude most women reporters from covering any story involving sexual harassment, abuse or assault. Very few among us has never encountered any of the above.

@followtheh Tom, I know.
A man kicked a 65-year-old woman to the ground in broad daylight on a Manhattan sidewalk on Monday, and stomped on her.¬†A second man standing in the lobby was unwilling to intervene. He closed the building‚Äôs door while the woman was lying on the ground. https://t.co/12Qo8HFoUj
@steveell This is true.
@NYTSports @kevinmdraper My favorite detail that we didn't get into the story: In one of our Zoom interviews with Kasten, he was hovering above his iPad screen because, he told us, his wife had lent his iPad stand to a neighbor.
This piece I wrote with @kevinmdraper about the new Major League Baseball season is published on the very morning I got my appointment for a vaccine.   Hope springs eternal.  https://t.co/AN9UxThgsS
It's not B.S. to say diversity matters for business success: the Dodgers needs to figure out how to broaden its fan base, which like all M.L.B. fandoms is pretty white and boomerish, in one of the most diverse cities in the U.S.
@velvet_falernum I know it was, and so was my reply! Best of luck to you. Keep me posted!
If I didn't know better, I'd think I was a sports reporter.  World Series champions @Dodgers start their new season tomorrow. @kevinmdraper and I took a look at the Dodgers front office to find out Stan Kasten's strategy for the team's success. https://t.co/AN9UxThgsS
@velvet_falernum I do feel lucky, and appreciative.
@cathyw1950 I'd drive to the ends of the earth but feel very lucky that I don't  have to.
@sternbergh You are so right! I flew to Seattle March 15, 2020, scariest assignment of my career. Surgical masks were in short supply. I got painters masks ($5/apiece) from a hardware store, and got trolled bigtime on Twitter by a doctor for wearing a needless mask. https://t.co/eGITmR9DHW
I feel actual optimism.
@cmchugh126 Could they hook me up with a great 3 bedroom near kids‚Äô schools and a subway stop?
I got my appt! Went through CVS website and was able to schedule directly with my neighborhood drug store.
@JamieStelter I am up and at ‚Äòem! I heard that eligibility meets the computer system at 8am.
@jessemckinley @NYGovCuomo Can we not sign up till tmrw? I just went through the website  as answered no to all comorbidities and essential worker questions and entered my DOB ... denied.
@brooke Yikes we were adorable.

@stdoyle I have several outside my front door if you need extras.
@racheld @johnjedwards3 @luxury @KellyGilblom I spelled his name wrong in my book acknowledgement section, which probably would not have bothered him had he known who I was and looked at my book.
@MatthewWVogt Literally, Matt. You‚Äôre welcome.

@Herring_NBA Hi! Would love to catch up soon! Hope all is well. GO BLUE!!
@Herring_NBA Your commentary is way better than anything on TV. I‚Äôm watching the TV screen and your Twitter feed simultaneously.
I texted one of my best friends last week and said, "I just put on a pair of jeans that I haven't worn in a year and I can barely zip them. Do I need to go on a diet?"  "What you need to do is throw out  the jeans," she replied. https://t.co/w2I2bwyq8y
