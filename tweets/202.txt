anyway at the end of the day i mainly just make things for Myself so i understand if nobody will ever really care about it as much as i do. avoiding communities and focusing on my own art is... fine for now, i suppose. at least not sharing will prevent me from getting hurt again

@nannelflannel AM SIT ON AURORA'S CHEAST AND AM HEAVY, BUT HE CANNOT BE MAD
All things considered, he's definitely more street smart than book smart, though he's still fairly well-educated for someone who didn't attend any prestigious academic institutions firsthand. Still, he'd prefer to use his charm, wit, or force to get what he wants.
As he grew older and started to get more involved in aether manipulation and Primal business, he took to researching these more advanced topics on his own. He hooked up with people with ties to Sharlayan for "special access" :)
All of Robin's formal learning was done at home under a number of private tutors Susuhe had hired, and they provided a solid educational foundation, though they would eventually focus more in the performing arts. His magic training was... mostly self-driven. https://t.co/uvQEJCAXCr
@blackwaltzno4 come on. he has to admit they're fun sometimes. plus, they get to hold hands :]
@Atticflowers1 Ok but it IS the superior hue  I feel like they would get along very well :)

@NOTAVAGNAR he does it to either deal psychic damage or inflict the "charmed" status on his enemies
it is 12:26 pm on monday and i am once again thinking about robin suhe's bosom
one thing that feels surreal about the nintendo switch is the fact that its home screen and eshop are Completely Fucking Silent with no funky background music to appease me while i browse and dissociate
*points to Aer* and YOU... you get bnuuy.  and also my tactic of being silly and making people laugh to distract from your fear of being abandoned and alone because if people don't like you then what's the point of anything-
*points to Robin* YOU get my crippling depression and insecurity about every single decision you make  *points to Yura* and YOU get my debilitating self-worth issues and overwhelming desire to feel useful to the people around you at the cost of your own well-being
just another day on primal, i see, https://t.co/cI501QcuZP

me a year ago: i just dont get why vtubers are so popular  me now: mmmm.....vtuber robin
I just think g'raha deserves to live his best life being smothered by booba
im calling myself out. this is a big fat lie. I do in fact shamelessly imagine elaborate robinraha amvs to certain vocaloid songs. i dont know what i was thinking. i am taking accountability for this heinous mistake https://t.co/3Up3BYvkIy
my brain is just filled with robinraha and vocaloid at all times, but never together  what if one day my brain decides to change that. maybe miku can sing at their weddi-
@blackwaltzno4 they make me want to commit arson

@fishuffxiv Idk i think he's a cool noodle
@Adithehella PLEASE do take your time and go at your own pace to enjoy the story, it's not worth rushing thru or skipping anything just to "keep up". You do you!!
what's more is that robin will have a p rude awakening with all these weird primal copies that AREN'T of his making and likely nothing natural :) this patch will feed my boy so well
hello we are here to free tiamat https://t.co/yKSbiuhK1O
wherever he is, drifting around in Robin's soul or whatever, I know Soph's gonna feel fulfilled watching ancient dragon mama fly again,, and so will Robin
Soph could never forgive himself for what happened to his family and his home before his untimely death, and carried that remorse into his next lives, just as Tiamat's grief was everlasting. They both suffered for so long
I've been SCREAMING for her to finally let us free her from her confinement and forgive herself for the past and what happened to her beloved and her kin, so seeing her flying around and free is making me... very excited for 5.5 and v emotional
Around Heavensward, Tiamat recognizes Robin's soul as that of her "little Ahm," but doesn't tell him directly and instead worries for him as a mother would,, they have this sad connection that Robin can feel, even if all he can do is visit her occasionally+
see im crying bc Soph (robin's past life from Meracydia) was raised by Tiamat and Bahamut and their brood in Meracydia, and helped fight back against the Allagan invasion only to watch Bahamut fall and Tiamat get imprisoned+
oh god when did twt's replies start looking like tumblr reblogs oh no
