@Honeypotbutt HECK YEAH
@Honeypotbutt why are you apologizing for being cute af????? it's not your fault they made these streets too narrow for a massive bunliz!
@Mikaufoxy that's the best kinda playlist tbh, something thatoves around with you and is constantly a lil piece of you!
@CarmellaWolfess THE STUFF YOU LISTEN TO IS VALID AF THO  you don't gotta apologize for what you love 💜
idk, it feels like everyone else has had a magical transformative experience and I've just. Existed.
that whole "what has the fandom done for you" tweet going around just makes me feel weird
@Mikaufoxy yeah!!! sharing playlists is so fun tbh
@CarmellaWolfess heck yeah heck yeah, that's the same reason I love it!!!
this has been the past 5 hours of my life  its worse b/c I keep thinking of cute friends that I'm love
me:*trying to work*  brain: fELL IN LOVE WITH A GIRL, I FELL IN LOVE ONCE AND ALMOST COMPLETELY/SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THE WORLD BUT SOMETIMES THESE FEELINS CAN BE SO MISLEADING  me:  brain: SHE TURNS AND SAYS ARE YOU ALRIGHT  me: why  brain:𝘐 𝘚𝘈𝘐𝘋 𝘐 𝘔𝘜𝘚𝘛 𝘉𝘌 𝘍𝘐𝘕𝘌 𝘊-
@meltingfoxy ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY YES you make for an ADORABLE balloon, just wanna sqrk and smooch and puffkiss on ya~
do people follow their friends on spotify?? I kinda wanna follow more mutuals on there just to see what they listen to
@HowNowGayCow WEED https://t.co/o3fAFdupJ7
I get where he's coming from b/c he just wants to nap after food but I am very much Not That
I think I'm just gonna say "yeah I'm having dinner earlier" and have that be that, if we have separate dinners then we have separate dinners
dinner at 6 means you have the rest of the night open, dinner at 9:30 means "I can't start anything at 6 b/c no one does anything at 6, by the time people start stuff I gotta go do dinner"
I blame roomie for being weird and eating dinner at like 9:30 instead of at like 6 like normal
I'm gonna get better abt actually hanging in vr  idk why it's hard for me to actually get on, like if it hits 9pm then it's like "well I might as well Not since it's so close to bedtime" even tho I don't go to bed till 10 or 11
@HowNowGayCow HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOO
@minicabbit DO IT DO IT DO IT BECOME FAE
@MapleMash don't worry, I brought my own hose, too! we can share and now we've got twice as much food to go around
@kingdude9000 @MapleMash imagining we'd fit in a table, pfft
@MapleMash a refill, and another run to all the local fast food drive throughs~
@MapleMash Omg I've been in the same mood myself!!! let's get huge 'n fat af together
@TheRadTags Neos is SO FUN yeah!!! I love just chilling with friends in there!!  it's so good for size shenanigans
@Caudlewag I wouldn't complain about gettin more Caudle!!
@ropistike yes yes yes yes yes  it's symbiotic, too, them helping you up onto counters and onto the windowsill. You could install ladders, but both of you agree it's cuter to do it together!
@LoboSabio2 oh noooooooo now we can't go together  I'll have to show you my haul later
I need two weekends tbh, one weekend to get high and laze around and one weekend to actually do writing and make that VrChat model I keep thinking abt and whatever
@meltingfoxy you've always been sweet to me and I'd say you've more than taken care of me 💜
@LoboSabio2 let's go together and go on a sugar rush
should I go to the candy store and get fun dip
I wish I had some fun dip tbh  might go to the candy store and get some &gt;w&gt;
@CarmellaWolfess Y'ALL IM GONNA GET FAT IF YOU KEEP THIS UP
@PuffWuffBalloon Obviously Round Box, I love that name x3
I'm using hashtags b/c I've actually lost a few short story threads and I don't wanna lose these
#FatVixie cw teasing, playful bullying  your fat fox friend falls asleep at the party  she wakes up to find someone's taped a 2 liter in her maw and she half drunk it out of instinct  she had been drunkenly talking abt how cute waking up with a Pepsi stuffed in her face would be~
@itsybatsy I CAN'T SAY NO WHEN YOU CONVINCE ME LIKE THAT look you gotta give me tummy rubs at LEAST cause my stomach is gonna be sore af with all this stuffing
it's a really chill weekend too, lots of snuggling, watching streams and movies, discussing the best candies, listening to cool music
your fat fox friend plans a "cheat weekend" where they just constantly guzzle soda and eat junk food and invite everyone to do the same  all you gotta do is agree to rub her bloated tum and get her more soda and you can snack as much as you'd like with her #FatVixie
your fat fox friend never walks around downtown without one of those comically huge Big Gulp cups  She gets cheap refills and shares with the group so it's always nice to bring her around 💜 #FatVixie
I like thinking of Vixie as "that fat friend of the group you gently tease on but still do things with"  that why I use second person in a lot of my fat fox gf tweets
@itsybatsy ONE MEAL AT A TIME smh y'all gonna make me fat
@jaidatruck I'm glad someone else also sees how it's like, the best part  I would eat a bag of nothing but these
@Serpentsaurus holiday of "feed you a bunch of chocolate and friends"
@Serpentsaurus plus her tail  wags so much when you feed her em, they hake her gut squirmy and fiesty for a few moments.
@Serpentsaurus I need sleeeeeeep but if a certain someone was to feed me while I'm snoozing, just plug my maw with a 2 liter, well who could stop them?
@Serpentsaurus She's definitely into it too, ordering more food, constantly kneading on her tummy, pulling her shirt up just to see those pawfuls of lard slosh around. Pretty soon, all the delivery folks know her and you well~
@Serpentsaurus Serp no Serp my stomach is too full as is
Your fat fox gf refuses to ever wear a shirt that covers past their chest, so their hanging, swaying gut is always on display. #FatVixie
anytime I write lil things abt Fat Vixie or "your fat fox gf" I'm going to tag it #FatVixie so block that tag if you don't wanna see
your fat fox gf gets to be an entertainment enjoyer! There's so much content out there, they need folks who can just laze and enjoy it.   It's taken a toll on her already-bloated figure, what used to be a good bit of paunch is starting to become straight up obesity. #FatVixie
