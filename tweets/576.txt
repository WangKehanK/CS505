i need someone to explain to me how i have an almost 60% win rating in Valorant but im a lower rank than what i started @PlayVALORANT
Yoooooo Im going live on valorant come stop by and say hi https://t.co/e0AQwuXyPw
I lose more RR on a loss then I gain on a Win
Live on valorant if anyone wants to stop by and say hi https://t.co/TafzTvys2b
Some girl just called me racist on Valorant cause i called some dude a big brolic black man quoting Jev. and she called me a stupid ass white boy. and when I said that was racist she said "I'm black I cant be racist just prejudiced" I hate the world I live in.

Come back to this tweet when Tony Bradley is an All star
This a W for the sixers. No embiid. Howard got ejected and Ben fouled out. And we still competed with a top3 nba team. The clippers lose in a series 100%
BBALL PAUL
EVEN JOEL EMBIID ISNT WATCHING THE SIXERS GAME
@Cuhmmando Even on duelist if you are setting up trades and getting information. As long as you arnt going 6-20. I’m stuck in gold rn so no one really knows what’s going on and think kills mean everything
The nba hates the Sixers
@Cuhmmando I love how you arnt afraid to show yourself go negative. So many people I play with will blame me for losing if I’m not positive
@PresidentEmbiid I can’t believe they traded Tony Bradley bro
This is the exact reason why we should have kept Tony Bradley. Howard is to big and strong that everything he does is a foul
Come back @ToBrad1
@Icy_Rapture I respect it
@Icy_Rapture Bro i forgot you did this
Anyone know why I’m only getting 120 FPS on Valorant on low settings? I usually get around 250 to 300 on high

The nba hates the sixers
WHY DID WE TRADE TONY BRADLEY I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND
Please surprise me mike Scott i want you to do good so bad
@PresidentEmbiid Mannnnn
@PresidentEmbiid MIKE SCOTT? Starting ???
MIKE SCOTT???
I’m so sad Tony Bradley was playing amazing he got so much better playing with embiid and Howard. All I can say is thank god we kept Maxey and Matisse
The sixers did not trade Tony Bradley

How much I gotta pay for you to make me a pair of crocs that have fur and look like normal crocs but this color way @Crocs https://t.co/QXuwnm0b5k
At first I wasn’t a huge fan of these black sixers jerseys but they starting to grow on me
I HAVE THE BIGGEST FUCKING BRAIN https://t.co/rqzsTL244K
According to this https://t.co/gVVmnNQ8Ut thing I have a headshot percentage on par with Radiants and Immortals. So i should be out of gold soon LMFAO
oh no he bouta get ratio'd https://t.co/LqO3vHU6tg
I WENT TO BUY THE PRIME VANDAL AND IT DISSAPEARED FROM MY SHOP WTF @PlayVALORANT
Is this Among us? https://t.co/VfF7SrO0Mz
i genuinely don't know how to control the recoil in valorant. I pull down like you are supposed to and i miss every shot. i can control the recoil in CSGO perfectly but in valorant i miss everyshot after my first bullet
love when my team auto locks duelists and cant get 15 kills. Meanwhile im stuck playing the worst character in the game trying to smoke shit for them and blind people and they do nothing with it. I go double negative and they go negative to. if i could play a duelist weed win
Gotta pour one out for embiid’s knee
i really wish i wasnt forced to play low rank game where people hide with shotguns to get to the higher ranks where i should be
I am either in too low of a rank or my team shouldnt be in this rank. this shouldnt happen https://t.co/yHtWAQzKjh
This isn't fair https://t.co/wkLcfTjayG
I almost just got a 7 kill ace and didn’t even know it
the second shot was definitely to close to work. but the first one was perfect range. its practically a slug
@PlayVALORANT i went into private match and tested it. At this range the right click should have 1 shotted him. but in game it decided to go right through him
Why @PlayVALORANT https://t.co/zjJp9qC9dP
@Rainbow6Game i recommend switching your game to a different engine. I dont wanna play a "competitive" game that is assassins creed
i don't recommend spending money on rainbow 6 siege. It might be one of the worst games ive ever played. it has worse hitboxes than csgo and bullets dont register on server side 90% of the time https://t.co/lVorzCnfNv
@Icy_Rapture @Boy1drr LMFAO
so we are playing against this kid who is blatantly walling. and my mouse decides to jump by itself https://t.co/su9aotzrjp
damn i wonder why im stuck in gold. all 4 of my teammates  we going afk and leaving https://t.co/cBSD98D3Oi
Lol https://t.co/afjt8Q7Q2o
I like how they rating the dunk contest this year. No one should get a 50. That means you were little perfect. It’s like the barstool pizza review you can’t give a 10 cause if somethings better than it you fucked your self
I got to witness CP3 finishing an Alley Oop wtf
This is why he is my favorite player https://t.co/ja2sDUqVjm
Bro idc about politics I’m tryna watch basketball
I’m gonna continue to watch the NBA no matter what but I fee like they are trying to get people to stop watching lmfao
Why are they singing the Canada song at the Allstar game it’s in fucking Atlanta
So Embiid and Simmons can’t play cause of Corona but MJ could play with the fucking flu SMFH https://t.co/q5v8SBeAEI
does anyone around gold and plat wanna play valorant i cant win in solo queue
I shouldn't be doing better than my duelists as Cypher EVERY SINGLE GAME
@ahad Lmao
@ahad This is gonna sound dumb but if I’m playing with friends we insta lock smokes and cypher so we actually have them used right 100% of the time
bro this left handed view model almost fucked me https://t.co/uk15CGRhJu
Can I buy this tweet? https://t.co/m7IQS2e3Na
Mac n’ chee
I have the best cypher hold NA https://t.co/6iCBrWGV7T
I can already see the click bait "aggressive cypher plays" https://t.co/V7yOhUyqin
Y’all excited over drake when we got 2 pop smoke songs????
@Boy1drr @Zendaya Vouch
it blows my mind that Valorant put me at silver 2. I went from silver 2 to gold 2 in 9 games LMFAO
If Donovan Mitchell dunked that that would have been insane
Literally 2 rounds later https://t.co/2MacuLtOyP
