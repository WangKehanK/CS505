@m_ruvalcaba14 @m_patino19 @_gabbyvargas @ashlynperkins4 Lmfaoooooo, same!!!
Kennedy and I are going into our 4th overtime round in cup pong currently. There looks to be no end in sight.
@BihmKelsey This is the type of energy I can get behind. 💯
I’m stuck between finishing my sleeve, getting my leg piece, or tattooing both my hands. 🥲
I was not prepared for the ending 💀😭 https://t.co/D6k3fFrl1F
@m_ruvalcaba14 I wonder if that man behind us at Rotolo’s last night still aggravated with us ruining his date with our existence. 😂😂
One bottle of water, one night quil pill, a nap, and two packs of fruit gummies later. Now I feel like I can take on the world. 😂
@nicklas_ewing Then come home to cuddle meeeeee 🥺
@taypellerin3 Whatcha gonna do with all that junk inside your trunk?
@m_ruvalcaba14 Soooooo pretty! 💕
@amphebert As you should! 😂
@m_ruvalcaba14 They will be back soon for your graduation. 🥺💕
@BlackH0legrunge *People in the south*
Does the cremation place take walk-ins? Asking for myself today.
@prezcarterledb I just did 5 months of long distance, drove 16 hours to get engaged and spend two days with him, only to go back to long distance for another 5-6 months. Its tough out here.
@m_ruvalcaba14 Right? How much crappier can they possibly get?
Wow, another reason I think Arkansas beats Louisiana as the shittiest state in the country. https://t.co/6L45pXaskZ
@cmaarieee For real! I feel you on that one.
@m_ruvalcaba14 Maybe you’re not sleeping enough. ):
@Cheenah_Marie Girl you cute. You could pull off a thirst trap lol. Yours don’t make me cringe or feel uncomfortable. 😂
@BlackH0legrunge I always just type out the word 😂
@BlackH0legrunge Dead ass. 😅
@BlackH0legrunge I genuinely didn’t know this.
This girl that does lip sync thirst traps on my Snapchat makes me feel uncomfortable and cringe. 😣
@nicklas_ewing Hey there handsome 😍😘
I find that living in Louisiana has me saying this to myself about 826 times a day. https://t.co/jrLB0qOGan
Jesus Christ how long does it take for someone to answer the phone at the fucking DMV?
Today feels like a Sunday.
@m_ruvalcaba14 Did everyone have a good summer 16 but me? 😅😂
Ordered a Hawaiian Punch at Popeyes and they gave me a Dr. Pepper. https://t.co/pPijNuXbod
Depends on the day. 😅 https://t.co/ZnUSeq2lVs
@Lavergne96 🤣💀
I’ve said this once, and I’ll say this again. Stop asking me for a discount on shit. This isn’t a pawn shop. You don’t have money, you shouldn’t be in a mall.
@m_ruvalcaba14 You’re going to be an awesome teacher!! ☺️ super proud of you!
I had the best weekend I’ve had in the last 4 months and @nicklas_ewing got the news he’s been waiting on! 🎊🥳
@taylorm_413 I love you! It’s gonna be okay! Don’t stress too hard!! 🥺💕
I haven’t even left the parking lot and I’m crying because I already miss @nicklas_ewing
Why does the sun have to be so bright in Chicago. It’s literally burning my fucking eyeballs into a crisp.
My ass is numb https://t.co/yU7yh7uZRi

@bafont3 I think it was just that everyone in SW Louisiana has been to KD’s at least once. So the roof is like a symbol of nostalgia.
@cmaarieee &amp; I ooop 🙊😂 I’m sure your roots can’t be that bad! Mine are halfway down my head lol. I’m pretty sure I’m about to strip my hair and dye it back dark brown.
@cmaarieee Your roots don’t even look bad at all! Like what? lol super cute!!
@ashlynperkins4 🤔 yess, I know the muffin man. The one who lives on Drury lane?
@ashlynperkins4 The muffin man?
@hausofyelyah @Jeep My Hyundai does the same thing!!
@ConstanzaKeith You gonna have to fight @nicklas_ewing for it. 😦
My phone calls with @BlackH0legrunge  and @nicklas_ewing  are my favorite time of the day. 🥰
@ConstanzaKeith You thought Starbucks was cute but I thought you were cuter!
@BlackH0legrunge I didn’t think I slammed it as hard as I did. But it’s tingling and hurts when I type with it
Pretty sure I just broke my thumb by slamming it in my car door. 🥴
@nicklas_ewing No, let the people know how you really feel. 🤣
@BlackH0legrunge Bitchhhh, I’ve been in denial. 🤣
If they bump their horn at me one more time I will turn this car off and sit on the trunk of my car and just stare at them.
The car behind me laid on their horn again at me. So now I’m really pissed at this point. So I take out my phone and start to tweet this. So in the amount of time it took me to tweet this, we’ve still been sitting at this stop sign. I hope they  learned their lesson. 😘
I instantly get pissed off. I rolled down my window and flipped them off. Then proceeded to get back to looking at the traffic to be able to make my left turn. Another minute goes by and I still don’t have an opportunity to go.
So I get to the stop sign and I put on my blinker to turn left on a busy double lane road. Not even 1 minute into me waiting for an opportunity to make this left turn the white SUV behind me starts laying on their horn.
I just pulled out of the bank and onto a side road to get back on the main road I needed to be on.  There was a white SUV behind me constantly riding my ass from the moment we pulled out the bank.
A thread:  I realized today maybe I do have bad road rage.
@Lavergne96 We all the daddy now. Fuck that dude for not wanting to be in her life!
