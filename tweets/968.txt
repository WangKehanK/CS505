@TaylorPettitt Congrats on being the jellicle cat! Happy birthday girl 😁 https://t.co/7dbiFvYBa9
@blackskybounty @thelorechief So please, let that brain worm fester in the back of your heads the next time you harass any of us because you can’t let shit go — we won’t give a FUCK ✌️
@blackskybounty @thelorechief the “better friends” line is rich coming from some of the backstabbing hypocrites you associate with 😊 we’ve already apologized and made our peace with the people who needed it, and nothing you or anyone else can ever say to me or my friends will ever fucking change that.
@blackskybounty @thelorechief banned with the streamer who was raided, so why does that give you the right be act so hard pressed? Just take the ban and move on. You can’t tell the streamer what to do and no amount of hatred will change it. The more you hatefully speak, the more ignorant you look. Oh, and...
@blackskybounty @thelorechief And you should get a better hill to die on than standing behind harassing someone who is preserving her corner of the internet and received permission from the streamer to do so. In fact, we don’t even frequent the places you all are anymore. I’ve never seen you or anyone else...

Concert band: French horn  Marching band: mellophone   I feel like we were more of an in-between of the brass &amp; woodwind worlds: commonly paired with the saxes most of the time we played, but could throw down with the best of the low brass during game day 😎 https://t.co/cfr1VAhpSj
@ShizukaHatake Hell yeah it is, it’s short but packs a punch - I love it too!
@Dingelle @PennieLane77 @RhamaLlama

@naiivnii @Magicpuddingfac Sadly it seems like people are getting lax or have had it and say it’s not so bad :/ they just don’t understand the effect it has on older adults, which is the age group we’ve seen affected most
Some more about COVID, especially compared to the flu. If we continue at this rate, we will run out of beds for those with (and without) the virus. This is our reality, future, and responsibility to care for ourselves and others!!  https://t.co/IXpu95IcS0
One thing I’ve wished to share with everyone about COVID is what it looks like from our POV inside the hospital &amp; the serious conditions our patients are in. Even IF you don’t end up like this, your loved ones can. Please wear a mask &amp; socially distance!! https://t.co/WruTh6ehsy
I work on a COVID ICU and I just walked out of the hospital after a 13.5 hour dumpster fire of a shift. Lots of very sick people.   Please, wear a mask (above your nose) and kindly ask others to do so too. We don’t want to have to code you or your loved one(s).
@PennieLane77 No but my birthday is coming up in a few weeks... 👀 lol
@DaemonOrisol This one is a song from Tik Tok, it’s so cute 😁  https://t.co/LY5WHQQnqL

Although it’s been 2.5 weeks already, my wolf pack has grown by one recently with the addition of Soot 💖 she’s a sweetheart, and I’m lucky to have her in my life! https://t.co/6S7jpI3AzJ

I’ve seen disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in COVID pts as a result, which means while your body is fighting clots in a certain area, that place uses up all the clotting factor in your body. This means that you can greatly bleed out anywhere else and it’s devastating. https://t.co/YIMN1dMKqn
@PennieLane77 @Mythical @DoctorSungTWRP @starbomb @LudoRock YAS QUEEN, you’re serving LEWKS! https://t.co/NCmPePwp8U
