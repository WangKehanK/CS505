@lovelauraxo_ i’m truly disgusted by the creepy old men that took advantage of us
so upsetting man.. so many feelings are being brought up from last summer that i haven’t thought about in months
reading that vice article really brought me back to when i was groomed as a 13 YEAR OLD by a fucking 19 YEAR OLD. !!!! no he was not a famous DJ but he was a fucking “man” and i feel so physically unwell rn

@thedancerjessxx hahaha thanks babe 🥰
@thedancerjessxx omg.i bet lol so much unnecessary standstill traffic too for no fucking reason
@thedancerjessxx i live in norfolk and it’s the worst

my bf had never seen legally blonde before so we watched it this wknd and he laughed throughout it and i could tell he enjoyed it soooo i guess he’s a keeper
like i don’t get how you can be all for human rights when it comes to cis women but trans women is where you draw the line? hateful ppl i tell ya
like they wouldn’t dare to tweet it themselves.. just passively retweet shit showing that they a full blown TERF
so disappointing when you follow someone on social media and they seem like a cool person and then they RT transphobic shit
sometimes you have to make sacrifices in order to get what you want though. one of those sacrifices for me was moving away from everyone i love
found bay access right behind my campus that i never knew was there   as much as it hurts me to be living away from all my friends in rva and family in NJ, little things like being able to walk to a body of water to just relax, makes me feel a lot less alone

@5_MeO_MaTT i knew it didn’t fully prevent infection but i thought it was like a slim chance. and if you do get it your symptoms likely won’t be severe
