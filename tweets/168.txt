“It’s only me, that wants to wrap around your dreams and have you any dreams you’d like to sell?”
Pretty sure god has been watching over me, I’m not even a real believer like that but someone is keeping a good eye on me and making sure I get stuff done 😂

I just hope everyone I don’t talk to as much is okay, I hope they got or are getting what they want and are happy! Just want the happiness for them man fr!!!

Your environment and the people in it can change you for better or worse..
If you don’t get up at 5am then don’t talk to me about “work”

Think together before deciding alone...
How many times have you reached the top, towards something you care most about?
Remember you look downwards almost never when waking up...
Think twice before you look both ways...
Waiting on someone’s downfall is not your success...

@UFCNews @ColbyCovMMA Kamaru Usman going to fuck him up AGAIN 😂 Calling Lebron spineless????? Lmfaooo 😭

Don’t overthink, don’t judge and just love it’s that simple☺️
I hope the person I’ve been dreaming about isn’t doing the same 🤦🏻‍♂️

comparison is the thief of joy..
