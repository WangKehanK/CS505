So. Don‚Äôt fuckin stalk my online status on Telegram or anywhere for that matter. It majorly freaks me out due 2 past bullshit I‚Äôve been thru. I have a hard time confronting this out of fear of my safety but pls just know it makes me never want to interact w/ u if u do this shit
Understand I have issues from a past stalker. It makes me not want to interact with you. It makes me scared for my well being. It makes me scared for my privacy. It makes me want to block you. It makes me scared for my mental health. This kind of shit fucks w/ me on a huge level-
They wake up or have the chance. It honest to fuck freaks me out and makes me panic. It makes me think they‚Äôre stalking me waiting for me to come online. It makes me panic and tbh it makes me want to block them. It makes me SO scared. I know that‚Äôs prob an overreaction but pls-
For me to come online because the message was INSTANT. I‚Äôm going to be honest, I‚Äôve had an internet stalker. For years. They would stalk and shittalk me. I do not do well with people stalking my Telegram waiting for me to come online to message me instead of texting me whenever-
I understand that you may want to talk to me, but please do not stalk my Telegram waiting for me to come online to message me. It freaks me out. Just message me whenever you‚Äôre up and I‚Äôll respond when I‚Äôm able. Because this seriously feels like they stalked my Telegram waiting-
I‚Äôm just going to touch on this briefly because it has been bugging me all day and I‚Äôm trying to not freak out.

I rarely upload to FurAffinity. It's kinda just a when I think of it kinda thing as opposed to here and Instagram.
Seeing someone reblog something from an old friend is.. something alright. Not a bad thing. Just funny feelings from that period in my life..
I kno my comms are not "Officially Closed" but I'm rlly slowing down with them. I'm crunching for my driver's license exam cause I bought a limited-time study thing. I was also given more hours @ work. I have very little time, so I'm not gonna be taking on any new work for a bit.
@got_fleas This is so cool omg!!!!
It‚Äôs been over 2 weeks now. This is getting a bit ridiculous. I just want an answer üòû
