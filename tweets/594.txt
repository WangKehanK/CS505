@JackValentino10 @spideyupdated No
@KRsolvz @kellysama_ Who do you think is the best then,
@ShaunaSmash @MorgainePen1 @scenestargaryen I never questioned the morality of the actions. But you‚Äôre comparing 2 individuals who have very different goals. If Arya was also trying to conquer a land and become a leader you would have a point
@ShaunaSmash @MorgainePen1 @scenestargaryen How is that weak? One is trying to conquer an entire continent, and the other is an assassin out for vengeance? Verg different positions. Thought that would be obvious
@GameOfThrones Imagine the marathon just has an entirely different endingüòÇ
@ShaunaSmash @MorgainePen1 @scenestargaryen They were in very different positions and had very different goals when they committed these acts. You can‚Äôt just compare the acts themselves. I understood your main point, just found it odd that you tried to relate it to Arya‚Äôs situation
@ShaunaSmash @MorgainePen1 @scenestargaryen The Arya situation is fairly different
@SYVLDNR @spac3jamjordan @SilkStash Every shoe he drops will sell out. Even the current Adidas shit. Yet you equate that to being irrelevant.
@SYVLDNR @spac3jamjordan @SilkStash You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong lol
@ssubhoney I do feel for what he had to deal with in his life. But I won‚Äôt act like there‚Äôs not something very dark and sinister about his ultimate actions.
@ssubhoney He says he loved his family but talks more about the plot of a TV series than about them. There‚Äôs no remorse. No apology. Just him believing that his decisions are ultimately right because he weighed the ‚Äúpros and cons‚Äù.
@ssubhoney Why can‚Äôt someone be mentally ill, but also just a bad person? There are so many depressed individuals that would never think of harming their loved ones. His story/logic is self-centered and flawed. It just goes in circles.
@ThisGrayArea Y‚Äôall need to rewatch season 6 because it does not deserve the hate it receives
@ThisGrayArea This is huge over exaggeration. No way y‚Äôall treating 5/6 like it‚Äôs 7/8. Just blasphemy
@gawdruso @bikeman04 @josegarseesit @FreeFolkMemes The Hound? The Mountain?
@bikeman04 @josegarseesit @FreeFolkMemes Jaime would carve through anyone Ned could name
@Koichis_Seed @RobertoMeadows6 @Dmjr03 and your King
@Koichis_Seed @RobertoMeadows6 @Dmjr03 He saved your King‚Äôs life
@SangoBeats @beatsbysavon Honey Bunches of Oats finally getting the love it deserves, stop sleeping people
@Zmargo702 @SangoBeats @beatsbysavon BRUH THE ONE WITH ALMONDS GO CRAZYYY
@brianlucas316 They say this type of bs every yearüòÇ
@ZohibMMA @TeamKhabib @TonyFergusonXT You witnessed prime Tony. We haven‚Äôt even witnessed prime Khabib yet. It‚Äôs be an ez smash
RATIOOO https://t.co/9AfudQFuYo
@TicSteel @ValorLeaks No
@htrdxfghbxt @vunefn @ValorLeaks Damn they patched it
@4nnti @S_Postletwaite @ValorLeaks Sova counters everyone, this isn‚Äôt really much of a point against Viper
@4nnti @S_Postletwaite @ValorLeaks That‚Äôs the whole point, you don‚Äôt push the smoke you can‚Äôt get onto site and plant lol
@milsvevo @HoeIsQuaking @ValorLeaks 1.5 seconds
@vunefn @ValorLeaks She can actually cover showers too if you line it up correctly through the TP
I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre kids, they need to be locked away for the rest of their lives. Peep the video in the replies. This shit is so sad https://t.co/5EAgrKxANZ
@woofwoof1030 Bro did you see the video? this shit got me heated rn
@naimamontana @cthebeast21 @CNN Was this one of your 69% trolling tweets? Fucking idiot
@leigh_mathis19 @MarkDice @CNN Yea perfect time to pull this one out your ass
@MarkDice Human body just laying on the floor helpless. The last thing he hears as he‚Äôs dying is a fucking idiot complaining about their phone. So sad to see man
@svvave @sam_belanger10 @BredBoyy @randyjcruz Lmfaooo all good
@svvave @sam_belanger10 @BredBoyy @randyjcruz Bro are you for Beal or against? I think you‚Äôre confused about what I said lol
@sam_belanger10 @BredBoyy @randyjcruz It‚Äôs not wild when there‚Äôs a 99% chance Beal giving his defender more points than they giving him
@theScore Once again KD competing for a ring on a team that would make the Finals without him
@wojespn All this to best a 36 year old
I just want to see Ngannou win tonight
@Spicy2K20 @felaback4L @goatshit23 @sipeuro @TheNBACentral Kobe avg‚Äôd 35 and 5 in a year which the NBA had one of the fewest possessions per game ever. And still didn‚Äôt top Harden‚Äôs highest USG
@Spicy2K20 @felaback4L @goatshit23 @sipeuro @TheNBACentral In an era with far more possessions and points per game, he‚Äôs not putting up those numbers in the early 2000s
@Jurab_ @sipeuro @Bogdan_Elite @TheNBACentral I believe they would‚Äôve
@sipeuro @Bogdan_Elite @TheNBACentral CP3 was the reason the Rockets even had a chance in the Weat lol
@AntManansala @sipeuro @TheNBACentral You‚Äôre a casual, learn the history
@sipeuro @B_Faucette @TheNBACentral Kobe has more 40/50 point games. He has better playoffs stretches. All Harden got is inflated stats in the highest possession era in history
@felaback4L @goatshit23 @sipeuro @TheNBACentral Harden had the ball in Houston more than Kobe in his entire career
@pipip00po0 @TerrysGOAT @TheNBACentral Y‚Äôall getting played by stats from one of the highest possessions eras of basketball EVER. Harden isn‚Äôt avg 35 and 8 in the early 2000s. The fact that you said ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù shows you know zero about the history
@kingkitchensII @Obeykb824 @pipip00po0 @TerrysGOAT @TheNBACentral A lot actually lol, especially early in his career
@kingkitchensII @KobeTakes @y0thrill @StepbackThreee @kd2ndburner @TheNBACentral Harden just started trying on defense, that‚Äôs a fact
@y0thrill @StepbackThreee @kd2ndburner @TheNBACentral Kobe was avg 35 in the mid 2000s. You know how much slower the game was back then? How many fewer possessions they had? Harden is not on Kobe‚Äôs level offensively
@quivers58 @TheNBACentral Kobe avg‚Äôd 35 in an era with 90 possessions/game vs 100 today. Also had 5 assist with that. There is zero argument
@4pfvxri @casualtakeking @TheNBACentral No lol
@TheNBACentral Stop putting Harden in the same sentence as Kobe
@nataleebfitness Still don‚Äôt understand how people defend billionaires. She obviously isn‚Äôt obligated to donate anything, but she also does not need a billion dollars in this life and her next 100 lifetimes
@Uncleseekx @Asensii20 @TheHoopCentral @espn Jordan scared of the Rockets
@CindtriIIella This with the tower of joy birth scene that cuts to Jon at Winterfell
@musiciswavyair @bansky It‚Äôs up there for sure, but I would take Winds of Winter over anything
Literally one of the best episodes in TV history https://t.co/DhA8YdecmM
@NotAdamAtAll @CindtriIIella Facts
@CindtriIIella I miss it so much
@brianajanae_ @UhWhoSaidDat @CindtriIIella Second this
@H0nestGentlemen @ryandali0n @KingJames Man stfu lol
@djifilm @AadamQureshi @Ghxu111 @KEEMSTAR You‚Äôre literally quoting made up shit, how have you not realized that yet
@vvs_the_great Why is it comparing peak Lil Baby to non-peak 50???
@NotTeak @HipHopNumbers MBDTF is #1 imo
@HipHopNumbers DAMN is better as well
@HipHopNumbers GKMC is better. MBDTF is the best hip hop album of all time.
@woofwoof1030 @elonmusk You a wizard or some shit
@cik02k @JakeSucky If League had voice chat it would be far worse lol
@ShahZaMk I saw some famous Hiko ascent plays you
@S0URDREAMS @Frank_2_24 @MoechillaSama @diceyzx @Ninja @pokimanelol First Strike was hugely successful, hope that Masters is even better
@S0URDREAMS @Frank_2_24 @MoechillaSama @diceyzx @Ninja @pokimanelol It literally is the biggest event they‚Äôve had yet
@IIzakesII @OG_Zerc @Gon_JJK @valesports_na @TSM_Myth @Ninja @pokimanelol @shroud Poki knows literally a fraction of what they they know about the game
@Callusion_ @valesports_na It's only temporary
@SStarsx @zSolosZz @Xyph_Playz @tower_ofbabel @daprcs Yup
@DerekTip @B15cuit @dafran You don‚Äôt need to explain that you‚Äôre close to finishing when both parties are willingly in some type of kink shit lol
@Puggyboiii @FarhanLayla @o9ito The guy that is spamming the same reply on twitter to defend his favorite streamer is calling other peoples lives useless lolol
@Puggyboiii @FarhanLayla @o9ito Bro why are you spamming this horrible take lmfao
@TheOGMadderz @GLeevez @JJaccuzi @Dexerto Your 2nd point is literally an opinion
@zygret @ZakingLIVE @Dexerto Obvious she‚Äôs being playful? What a joke lol
@Dexerto Clearly he was a dick of a boyfriend. While I don‚Äôt think that the audio evidence is 100% solid proof, my interpretation of it is that there was abuse involved. I believe her
@ItsJasonCreed @Maple_Guild @itzcrimsun @MarukoTsm @Dexerto @ValorantUpdates Why would he need to explain himself that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs close‚Äù and tell her to ‚Äústop‚Äù multiple times if it‚Äôs a kink and he knows it‚Äôs a kink? If it was actually that type of situation, he would have much different responses
@DerekTip @broccolibreker @Cle0H Can‚Äôt tell is this reply is a joke or not
@chizmoe1 @jesvswalks @mohamedmazhar_ @YCSNOW23 One scenario last year with a Clippers defense that was underperforming in general. It will be different with the Lakers
@dhaneshjpatel @MichDeji @NBAMemes My no is to your ‚Äúbut yes‚Äù
@dhaneshjpatel @MichDeji @NBAMemes No
@liliafes90 @ufc @JanBlachowicz @TrojanCondoms HuhüòÇ
@BWFCOwenn @ufc @JanBlachowicz Might be
I‚Äôm sorry but Izzy stands no chance again Jon Jones, he would get dominated on the ground just as much
What a smart fight by Jan, played it safe early and dominated on the ground late
Jan won that fight
Great round by Jan, so much stronger
