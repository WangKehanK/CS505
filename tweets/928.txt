Today I am thankful to be reminded of my bisexuality. Thank you god for women, amen üôè
@nollers My mom looked up other zip codes and that's how she found me one in Stratford this Saturday
@BeccaK_0201 So kinda whip its but not https://t.co/JpxSeUdTVx
@BeccaK_0201 Is it another word for boner? Lol
@emmadavola Too many imo
@MamaGercks76 @GovNedLamont It's 90 days from when you first tested positive, my mom just had covid and this is the recommendation from her doctors.
Proud of myself for how I've been handling everything this last week. I've stayed strong, stayed on top of my shit, and have been making really good choices. Here's to growth üíö
I have the hugest talent crush on this guy at work who's almost old enough to be my grandpa. Not only did this man remember my birthday but a bitch got some baked goods too ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
I need a hug. My shit's together, but goddamn is this the hardest thing I've gone through alone. Hug your mom for me today.
*every day https://t.co/13N9sHHLLv
Through @lizzo all things are possible. Thank you queen for your music today ‚ù§
Fuck depression for pushing the people I love out of my life. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. It feels like I'm working against a 1000 pound weight and my efforts make no difference. Being ill sucks, don't do it.
Wishin I could hug my mom right now
@Rican_Neyo_52 I miss doing shows so much üò™
You know when depression just slaps you in the face and you realize how badly you've been doing for a while? That's tonight and idk what the fuck I'm doing anymore
@Miss_XXXmas Almost like people change with time or something, crazy. You don't owe anyone anything b
@nollers I'm taking FIN 100 it's super easy and an awesome elective class. Highly recommend if you're looking for an elective. Since class is once a week on Fridays, we've only had two classes and don't meet this week because of presidents day weekend.
@nollers Also always assume WCSU has no idea what's going on. I had a class last fall where the professor disappeared a couple weeks into the semester and the head of dept didn't do anything til Thanksgiving. We had to restart the course and finish during intercession. Communication = üëé
@nollers I've learned to be my own advocate in terms of registering for classes. Add/drop will be open for another week for professors (they don't tell students), I think you'll need professor and maybe dean/head of dept approval to add. Electives shouldn't be too hard to catch up on!
@__Newms Trophy husband?
@nollers Nice! I thought it would have been funny if we ended up having the same prof lol. Lmk if you have any questions about wcsu bb
@nollers Who's the prof?
@glcoverd Quick reminder: ur hella cute no homo
@eliseengbo_ Love you for this üíö Newtown could not have gotten a better instructor than you!
@Miss_XXXmas Girls support girls üí™
@EliasNikit Wtf why that's fucking stupid
@Miss_XXXmas I think intimacy is important, doesn't necessarily always mean sex!
@nollers I'm 90% sure there's a study where sleeping 2 shifts of 4 hours is just as effective as one 8 hour period
If this isn't the most 2020 thing ever... https://t.co/sFxlwF5Atq
@EliasNikit It's called God's work
Nauseous and tired of today, haven't been this anxious in a while
@EliasNikit My mom says that she actually admired him and how he handled 9/11 but something changed since then, must have drank the cool aid!

@EliasNikit I don't know anyone who has guessed correctly while watching it tbh
@Miss_XXXmas That's so fucking stupid lol!! I hope your bf understands, it can be difficult when your own family is causing the problems. Good luck bb I hope she fucks off ‚ù§
@Miss_XXXmas Fuck yes!! If they ever show up just show them your OF set up, I'm sure they will HAPPILY never return lmao
@Miss_XXXmas I know exactly what you mean! My family can't even have holidays together anymore, definitely not the example they should be setting. Maybe it's time for house rules for guests? Smh
@Miss_XXXmas So awful that her own nephew fell in love with you! It's really none of her business and is dentimental to any future relationship with her own nephew because she couldn't keep her mouth shut.
@Miss_XXXmas Ask her who she thinks is behind the camera...
@EliasNikit That's me tbh I like some of our local reps regardless of party

@kelseynix26 üò≠üò∞ü¶Æüò≥üò¨ accurate lmao
I keep having nightmares about showing up places without a mask
@EthanDupont4 Because they can
@EliasNikit Wow this took me back, like if you remember mme maxwell
@mjglvr Honestly if you google symptoms of adhd you'll be surprised what is considered a symptom
Rt if you remember the Peter Plague (aka flu) at NHS spring 2014. Cast would be straight up vomiting their brains out during intermission and go back on for act 2 https://t.co/xEwyqtN4PH
Anxiety is just really bad conspiracy theories about your own life
@ricktor_exe That's called alcohol poisoning
I will never get over the fact that I did not live at the same time as Leonard Bernstein... salty af to those who have seen him conduct live
Pearson math lab also cost me over $100 so it can absolutely SUCK ME
Pearson math lab won't work on my laptop because I have windows 8 and my professor dead ass told the class that technology is no excuse and we have to go to campus.... bruh I paid EXTRA for your mother fucking class so I DON'T have to go to campus.... smh...
@mjglvr Grudge
