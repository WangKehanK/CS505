Here I am minding my business just having people create stupid drama in my life over nothing . Fuck You
I’m so pissed off for something that shouldn’t be pissing me off I’m so done
@Chace_Ikeda @carter_yost It was one pasta dish that was made with only 3 ingredients ya it could of had more but it was fine I never fucking complained
@Chace_Ikeda @carter_yost No more like let’s stop creating unnecessary drama that is over something that was blown out of proportion ? I ain’t dealing w this drama rn
@Chace_Ikeda @carter_yost Yeah
