My belly button is starting to stick out !!
Finn always refers to his future sibling as “our baby” and it’s so cute
Also??? Kayaked several miles in the ocean yesterday at 5 months pregnant. I’m feeling like a badass. Ngl probably my last excursion before the baby comes though I’m tired haha
I was floating in a kayak yesterday in the Intercostal Waterway and the baby loved it so much they were kicking all around it was so cute. I love them so much already.
Finn is running laps around the inside of the house butt naked yelling “I’m not gonna take a shower!!!” With all the animals following him in a line 😂
😭😭😭❤️ https://t.co/sys5DuCY1h
@cause_vr I’m taking all these fire ideas straight to my artist lmao
Yates booking me a tattoo like a month after I have this baby is true love
@xivyd Same here girl same here
Yeah I made that post and immediately went to sleep for 3 hours
Ended the relationship for her own sake. She didn’t care enough about me to keep me safe. She doesn’t deserve a spot in my life. She shouldn’t get to pretend to be the family savior. I’ll probably never forgive her. The end.
That was the last time I saw him. Years later I went through extensive therapy including hypnotherapy to piece all of this together. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD. The older I’ve gotten the more I’ve realized her role in this. She knew he was bad and doing bad things but she never-
To realize that the way he was acting was abnormal. I remember sitting in my last class of the day (PE) and sobbing to my friends at the time that he was coming and I didn’t want him near me. They helped me piece together why. I barely slept that entire weekend he was there.-
The only person who was concerned about his weird behavior towards me was my brother. I remember him getting heated and yelling at my family that he was so weird towards me and he stormed off. I was I think 13 then. The last time Corey came to visit was when I was old enough-
Crisis that we had to communicate during. It was the first time we’ve spoken since December 2019. She had no idea why I wasn’t reaching out and that it was because of this, and she’s made absolutely 0 efforts to communicate otherwise.
It’s safe to say she’s never allowed around my kids especially alone. I’m tired of her prancing around like she’s a good person when she allowed this to happen and did nothing to stop it or help me after the fact. Yesterday she tried to strike up a conversation during a family-
I’m tired of protecting her and I think everyone should know what she allowed to happen to me.
Because we are a blended family and I just wanted everything to be normal and okay. When I told her what he did to me after they broke up (I was 15) she did nothing. She did tell me that he used to do this to his younger sister though and that didn’t raise any red flags for her.
Phone up. He would pull me onto his lap and tickle my hips in front of my sister. My sister was an adult during this entire period of time. I am now the oldest she was during this period of time. When I was younger I tried to excuse it for the sake of our sisterhood and family-
Molest me while I was asleep. I am a very heavy sleeper but I would wake up some mornings to him stroking the backs of my thighs and touching me. I was 10-14 when this was happening. He texted me every day when he wasn’t there and would get angry if I didn’t reply and blow my-
My older sister told me ten years ago she was aware her boyfriend at the time was being hella creepy towards me and constantly made dirty jokes about me when I wasn’t around, yet she let that continue for five years. During that time he would sneak into my bedroom and-
My older sister trying to be the hero is so fucking funny to me
lolol no I will not “pick you up” from the ER during your psych evaluation
It’s okay y’all my brother made me CEO of the planet today we’re good
Clearly I “don’t understand mental illness” 🥴
This has been the longest week and I am so tired
I love my local greenhouse !!! https://t.co/r0hdZdIXMG
I need a plant friend
My elephant ears are coming back 😍
Only feel like I’m missing out on 2 things due to this pregnancy: My COVID vax and my ability to ride rollercoasters
I will argue with anyone about vaccines. Get the damn shot. Grow the fuck up.
I love stupid IG filters https://t.co/VZxkXZu0Xr
god I really hope I can throw a baller holiday party this December
Also Finn slept at his grandparents last night and I slept 13 hours straight I am ✨refreshed✨
My ob offered to tie my tubes during my c section if I wanted and like before she asked I was team no more kids but now that it could be permanent I’m scared to decide that lol
wow I have the two cutest dudes https://t.co/cnBKUeXqBy
The writing is phenomenal and this is an excellent article about the realities of K and psychedelics. Ketamine is a wonderful treatment for depression in my personal experience. https://t.co/5YsswlIbc5
Imagine being bothered that other people are enjoying things that you’re too scared to ever try
I made potstickers which I normally love but squish had other ideas
I thought there would be like this hole in my life losing such a close friend but damn shit has really improved
Imagine you pay 300$ a month total in food/shelter/utilities etc and then have the audacity to treat the person providing that for you like complete shit
Genuinely can’t believe I let such a horribly ungrateful person take advantage of my kindness for so long.
Me forcing Yates to listen to smash mouth on full volume
I know it’s not for everyone but I truly love being a mom so so much
@xivyd DUDE I HAVE BEEN LOSING IT 😂😂 I’ll have to send you the screenshots hold on
Apparently my dad googles viagra so often its the first result in his browser and he thoughty husband changed the destination of his company’s website to that and sent him a text freaking out. If I have to know this info so do you.
I just got a call from a wrong number and she tried to argue with me saying I had called her first??? Who???
@totally_not_ang Sounds good!! :)
@totally_not_ang Oh hell yeah! We just moved out of the city over the summer we’re about 40 mins south in SC. Little town called Lancaster

@Melissa__x0xo Yeah that’s a difficult rule with littles 😂 at least it’s getting detailed today!!
I’m going to an island in three weeks with no cars, stores, roads and very limited WiFi. The only way to get anywhere is to walk or ride a golf cart. There is no bridge to the island you have to take a water taxi. Excited is an UNDERSTATEMENT
@Melissa__x0xo I’m always like that with my cars so when I eventually do get my Tesla (fingers crossed lol) this will probably be me hahaha
Our house is 2600 square feet and all one story so I have to send Finn around almost daily to figure out where roomba died 😂
