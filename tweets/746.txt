@iwritecoolstuff ok well i deleted my past tweet, but basically i wanted to say this, and anti semitism are issues in leftist communities. i also wanted to say that critizing israel isnt anti-semtic, as myself, a jew, does quite often.
@superpieguy44 @iwritecoolstuff can i ask how come? i dont see why having them both share or come to some sort of agreement isnt feasible?
@xXSad_boi420Xx @yxngraspy @iwritecoolstuff i wish i can edit that tweet cause i was pretty misinformed, thanks for your clarification of zionism!

@yourtubboo hi im the end void
@lissieeeee @morgvanny @13weissevan @iwritecoolstuff i had a basic premise of zionism, but i wanted to definitive definition to use as my now bad example. my point was anti semitism has been prevalent in leftist communities.
@morgvanny @13weissevan @iwritecoolstuff thank you for sharing this, definitely opened my eyes!!
