@vetleforsland Someone once tweeted "just saw someone wearing spectacles in public AMA"  I asked her what planet she was on and unfortunately never heard back from her.  Mars? Earth? Another galaxy?   I still don't know
@vetleforsland Same. Spectacles by snap? Not so much

@Tristanwaine @investor_bad That‚Äôs awesome --I love it. I also recently converted @talbottzink to this as well
Over shorter holding periods in stocks reinvesting less of their earnings each year ‚Äì the price you pay matters more.  Over longer holding periods where the stock is reinvesting almost all of their earnings each year ‚Äì the return on reinvestment matters more.
How Much is Too Much to Pay for a Great Business?  Here‚Äôs what matters‚Ä¶    * Price / Asset (equity, invested capital, etc.)   * Amount of earnings reinvested in the business  * Return on that reinvestment
