It‚Äôs taken me a while to get truly hooked on Persona 5 Strikers but I beat the 3rd jail today and the story just all the sudden got so much more interesting.
@FrogChampBM @KateyTheRatGirl It‚Äôs just a conspiracy /s
@FrogChampBM In the US and Canada it is. It‚Äôs been taken off in other parts of the world though for a couple years. Also m b v and EPs 1988-1991 were never on streaming
@FrogChampBM Music coming to streaming. It‚Äôs been the talk of the town on the mbv subreddit
My parents and I just got new vans it‚Äôs about to be a white boy summer

Wtf... https://t.co/i87esAtNbF
@thotpiIgrim Did it get leaked?
I miss Chadwick Boseman
@boringangel_ If there was a dedicated channel for it I think it would probably go over well. It would pretty much act as background noise which is what the radio is in the first place.
@thotpiIgrim No I agree but so does how to be a ninja
I had a dream I was going to a playboi carti concert and right as I got to the venue I remembered I had an orchestra performance that same night

@soyboybrin There‚Äôs three groups of students and one group is on campus per day. The other two do virtual in the afternoon. I‚Äôm pretty sure all the teachers are at school
@soyboybrin Yeah I feel like we‚Äôve been good about mask wearing and also the class sizes are small. My English cohort only has one other student besides me
