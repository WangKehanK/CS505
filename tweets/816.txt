@xefars @OboTheHoboFLFOD @marincruz_ @gmarieallen @chuckyexists @faymedinuh my bf got into the geology masters program at lsu with a 2.7, he has been working on an independent research project for 2 years, and his gpa with only geology courses is a 3.2
@VanaahPopsh_t @RS_miml @Destoni19 will never understand ppl who rly are just like yes i think u should make urself uncomfortable so i can feel like u followed some dumb rule and came and spoke to me
@SkylarBroussard Pls
lmao @ my aunt and uncle deciding not to speak to me anymore because they “don’t know how i got so liberal”
@ItsChrisGeisler @svddendeathdub Are you this fucking stupid geology is deadass the study of the fucking earth lmaoooo
@ItsChrisGeisler @svddendeathdub the pipeline 200% is not some of the “cleanest energy” it literally was supposed to be made to transport the nastiest fossil fuels out there. and nuclear energy isn’t the cleanest because uranium doesn’t come from no where. “do some research”
@Ducatislim @_Guyrey @commiexmommie ok. well as of now possession is a “crime”. doing drugs is a “crime”. and neither should be.
@Ducatislim @_Guyrey @commiexmommie the % of addicts who end up harming others is low- most addicts are functional addicts. and for the low % of addicts who do commit other crimes, u can lock them up for those other crimes. there is zero reason to criminalize addiction.
@ismaellozano11 @heyitsaudraaaa @Ghastly there’s literally ppl who saw the bird after the guy had it.
@ZAKenworthy Without those socialist systems it would have been nearly impossible to get to where i am now. Which kind of goes back to your point of education, which I agree is the root of what needs to be re-evaluated for people to get out of poverty.
@ZAKenworthy My point is it doesn’t always fail. And even if it did fail at pulling people out of poverty 100% of the time, I still wouldn’t support letting children starve.
@ZAKenworthy At 18 using socialist systems in place I was able to go to college. Now I am able to make enough money to support myself on my own. Alternatively I could have made $7.25 an hr, hope I could pay rent, and us d food stamps. I’m not sure why u think someone would choose the latter.
@ZAKenworthy I don’t think that’s lazy but that’s not even what we’re discussing. It’s whether or not welfare stops people, in general, from pulling themselves out of poverty. which it doesn’t.
@ZAKenworthy It is kind of bold to assume that people who may need extra money to survive *dont* like work just bc they hold different political beliefs than you.
@ZAKenworthy do you think if you were receiving food stamps while you were living in your car you would still just not work?
@ZAKenworthy agree w education but why do you think the welfare state makes them dependent? feel like this operates under the assumption that people enjoy living in poverty so long as the govt is giving them money. and most people in poverty are not paying much if any taxes.
@ZAKenworthy Ok but it’s obviously not f them I’m worried ab me and mine. and if u don’t think “handouts” is the way then what
@ZAKenworthy Well maybe I’ll just “decide” to fill out a 3949 :-)
@ZAKenworthy Yeah I know they can but I also have the empathy to be willing to make it more possible
@ZAKenworthy it might be fucking hard for you to conceptualize but some people are BORN into fucking poverty you sound privileged and a lot like one of the “dumbasses” that would be a bad investment
@ZAKenworthy and since you’re so keen on “personal accountability and responsibility” move somewhere that doesn’t have taxes then.
@ZAKenworthy nope it is not personal accountability when you are saying it doesn’t matter if it is your personal decision or not
@ZAKenworthy Ok thanks for finally saying what I already knew. The real reason you don’t want to pay taxes is they don’t affect u directly and u could care less if someone is dealt a shit hand bc u lack empathy. No need to cover up w ur original BS. :)))
@ZAKenworthy and if u say u don’t wanna pay taxes bc u don’t have empathy or u don’t care about society as a whole, that’s fine. that is a valid argument though i think it speaks to ur morals. but ur original argument is not and simply isn’t true.
@ZAKenworthy I never asked does it affect you I asked do you DESERVE to have it affect u. When more people in society are able to function to their fullest ability, it benefits society as a whole. In that respect society benefits as a whole, from taxes, whether they benefit u directly or not.
@ZAKenworthy No, thanks but that’s not how it works. I don’t deserve a shit life bc someone else made a shit decision. quit pretending “oh it would be beneficial to society if there weren’t taxes” when what u really mean is “it would be beneficial to me”.
@ZAKenworthy ok cool so I deserved to suffer because of someone else’s decision thank u mr econ I get ur point now
@ZAKenworthy that was my decision tho?
@ZAKenworthy yes but u would have to show that it would go down ENOUGH to make it cheaper than taxes
@ZAKenworthy my dad has been in jail my whole life and my mom died when i was 10 so :))) not everything is ab good decisions or bad ones.
@ZAKenworthy oh and i was able to live thx to govt assistance
@ZAKenworthy Uh, thank u I know how supply demand works but there’s nothing backing up ur claim that it would become cheaper than taxes. u can’t just assume that based on supply and demand theory u need actual numbers. many private schools have just as many students and still cost more.
@ZAKenworthy that’s cool. my mom died. my dad went to jail. i was LUCKY enough to have friends to alternate staying with. had i not i would have been homeless. wouldn’t have had a car to live in wouldn’t have had 10k to start a company.
@ZAKenworthy tuition at a private school is usually more than $11k u have no source to back this up
@ZAKenworthy oh wow was it ur own bad decisions that got u there? lucky of u to have a car.
@ZAKenworthy nope. like i said. avg cost of per student in Louisiana is $11k. taxes for someone making $35k a year is around $6k.
@ZAKenworthy it’s really okay u can say “i was not put at a disadvantage and therefore don’t care about other people who were and want more money” u don’t have to make up some fake argument
@ZAKenworthy wow thank u almost all of those things cost money. and most people aren’t poor because of bad decisions lmao. good one tho. u have no idea what ur talking about there is no logical basis for ur argument.
@ZAKenworthy ok, so like i said, you do not care about poor people or what happens to them. poor people deserve no mail, their houses can burn down whenever, if a crime is committed against them oh well. people deserve equal opportunity. your arguments are based in nothing more than greed.
@ZAKenworthy where i live 37% of children under 11 live in poverty. who is going to pay for those vouchers? and no, the school system is beneficial. most parents do not have the time and that also sets it up to where if your parents were uneducated then now you too, will be uneducated.
@ZAKenworthy then advocate for reallocation not privitization. louisiana (who is pretty low in education) spends an average of $11k per student in public school. i am all for paying taxes when privatization would only mean already disadvantaged poor children are further hurt.
the avg american does not pay anywhere near 15k in taxes per year and when u advocate for privatization of schools, mail, roads, etc. it starts to really sound like u just hate poor people https://t.co/kzGfiXlVmv

@angelicaevk @Izzyalright @Jennniferrruiz 1 time this apt complex lied and said they had availability when they didn’t and tried to keep my app fee. i kept calling for like 2 months ab a refund and this lady rly told me “we tried 2 weeks ago but the internet was slow”. threatened to call my bank &amp; she had it the next day

@freedmspeaks @John18569920 @nytimes no one said anyone is forced to be in the military i was responding to his suggestion that people receiving loan forgiveness should have to do military service in return
@John18569920 @freedmspeaks @nytimes the idea that people born less fortunate than those wealthy parents need to participate in some grandeur gesture to “earn” going to college is bs. college should be free and u should “earn” going by getting in.
@John18569920 @freedmspeaks @nytimes and no i don’t think community service should be required. most of these people have full time jobs. college should have never been made into a commodity that costs loads of money in the first place.
@John18569920 @freedmspeaks @nytimes no i am suggesting that the cost of college is way too high for an 18 year old to pay, and so there is almost no way around the loans, and the government making interest off of them making them extremely difficult to pay back is what’s predatory.
super sad we have to wait like 3 months to actually know tho :((
@John18569920 @freedmspeaks @nytimes and? why force people to work in the military when there are plenty of people in the military as is. somehow no one has any problem funneling money into the military (which has plenty btw) but when the govt wants to help regular ppl w predatory loans it’s a problem
@ju_fields some r lucky enough to have both 😌
i can’t believe after 17 years of dealing with severe epilepsy my brother might be able to finally live seizure free
@CoachPeterHayes @WSJ your taxes are not going up to pay for it so really nothing changes for u
@BrandonFulton89 @benjamingregson @ragregg ok so who is it for then? rich people? and not everything is about how high your job pays some people have interests.
other people’s debt being forgiven literally does not affect u
@CoachPeterHayes @WSJ this take is ridiculous. u want other people to struggle because you had to save money. ur daughters are lucky to have parents who were able and willing to do that but not everyone is as lucky. something that benefits others doesn’t harm u.
