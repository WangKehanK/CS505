How are you not even doing a show in Buffalo https://t.co/MJoh3KtlDu
@sjmanzare That’s the exact problem with this entire administration right now. They believe that their face value change and slogans is all that was needed. That’s why I want something actually changed and done now because there are no more excuses. Power is held so let’s make progress.
@sjmanzare I fell for many of them today😞
@sjmanzare I do not care what you may look like, rather that your ideology is correct.
@sjmanzare People that actually care and work for the true needs of the American working class. That are not all privileged status quo background citizens, that continue to stay out of touch with the majority of the population. The break from a centuries old status quo is the goal.
@sjmanzare The point is by saying that just because they are not all just white men does not enable it to be labeled as “This is what America looks like”. Every developed nation is full of diversity and it just shows how lacking and systematically racist the system is.
A tenth of them live in poverty? A portion of them are homeless? Some have no healthcare? Back loaded with debt? https://t.co/UfuD1BLMHk

@kylegoodnick My statement still stands but then I shall retract it from him.🤝
We don’t want classes in society; classes are a made up figment of society intended to hold other citizens down. https://t.co/s7mX4Hs2ts
Well Washington D.C. also was not a thing yet as it wasn’t the U.S. capital. Things change and improve with time sir. It’s called progress. https://t.co/68xtfs6Xqp
