@NikitaDragun @trishapaytas Nikita actively does blackface, literally changes her ethnicity daily - PLZZZZZ at least trisha isn’t participating in white supremacy activity,, sending prayers !!
@NikitaDragun @trishapaytas if any brands are paying attention - we seriously don’t want to see anymore Nikita. She isn’t a good influence on anybody. she ruins the timeline consistently - does black face, hangs out w pedos and is just overall a disgusting person. We don’t want to see her anymore
@NikitaDragun @trishapaytas we want nikita off social media! begging for it
