@jesawyer this is a dream car for me
@succserer gordon is impossible to please. this is bullshit
@SlTHSKYWALKER @Zontar_Dow @thea_wake @Aaron_Skyguy oh definitely, it’s at minimum probably 5 years away before any production starts if not longer, but lucasfilm would be stupid to ditch an oscar winner because some fans are really loud about not liking him and some “fans” send him death threats
@YIndigence I love nerrel so much
@Zontar_Dow @SlTHSKYWALKER @thea_wake @Aaron_Skyguy why would there be news when he’s said he wants to do Knives Out 2 first? they have the next five-ish years planned to the letter. I predict they’re going to have Knives Out releases and his trilogy releases staggered once the ball gets rolling.
@succserer are you cody ko or the dog
@succserer thought the first one was jerma
@succserer i am going to kill you
@zandocalrissian @1nternetgirl404 @clank1022 @meesa_meesa tf do you mean “why do you even need to bring racial terms into this” the tweet he made is in racial terms
I bought a signed copy of Uncut Gems on vinyl but the seller shipped the records in the sleeve so it has splits (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ @0PN https://t.co/G52G779XRt
