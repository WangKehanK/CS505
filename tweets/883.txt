Trying to decide if I should hit the gym before tonight’s crusade on my liver ?

This version of myself (in my head) i can really get behind
Really coming into myself
Getting home before dark is a gift I appreciate most
My ex just text me to ask me if his ex is dating a mutual friend.   That’s gotta be the biggest flex of 2020 so far.
Went to bed at 9:30 last night. #welcometo29
In true Pisces fashion..I waited until today to find something to find to wear

Hey was in an emotional rut the past few months..I can now say, at this moment I am not. Something just clicked. Not sure if that’s because of mercury retrograde but let’s keep it up
No way am I’m super progressive or democratic socialist but they got my attention
The only candidates that actually have my attention is Bernie and Warren.
Also Mayor Pete you gotta do more than be a great speaker.
Joe...sit your ass down already
Always considered myself a moderate Democrat however the ones in the race like Klobuchar and Biden aren’t it.
@R0BZZZZ https://t.co/Gx6XfnZ5GG
Wasn’t gonna but the gym today after being domestic..just took a huge scoop of pre workout to the dome
When does doing laundry stop?
