Does any one else who is on adderall experience this? Like am I okay?! Lol
It’s just really bad anxiety that comes out of no where so now instead of focusing on my homework I’m just focusing on trying to breathe when in reality I’m fine so I don’t know why this is happening????
I hate ADD bc whenever I really need my adderall to help me focus, sometimes I take it when I’m feeling kind of stressed &amp; then it just amplifies that stress &amp; I become so anxious &amp; can’t breathe but like Idek what’s really wrong so I feel like I’m freaking out for no reason???
Nothing feels better than people noticing and complimenting your gym results 🤩🥰
