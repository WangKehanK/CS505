@ThisBeNekro sure uwu, you know mine i believe. i need to force myself to do art anyway
@Potato_Noire theoretically you could get a double team kill on the enemy team with a boop into an environmental kill and your team with the amp heal thing LMAO.
@piinkkyyyy yeah, but if this gets added to live, it makes lucio actually unplayable, and he is my main and I have like 135 hours on him rn :weary: lmao
since it will be "negative healing" with the amp (aka damage lmao)
Basically, devs forgot that lucio's amp still applies to teammates out of range for a few seconds no matter how far they are, and since healing is based on distance to lucio now, if someone like sombra gets far away fast enough and he amps, they can get instantly killed.
Overwatch is so broken now, that you can instantly kill teammates as Lucio instead of healing if they get out of his range while he amps in the new experimental patch. https://t.co/2nBgkb7eG2

@ZeeLeafs Any function or a parabola? If any function, take the derivative and set it equal to 0 and all the solutions are the x coords of your vertices. For a parabola depends on form. Standard form: use x=-b/(2a), then plug in x.  hk/vertex form: bro its literally the only numbers smh
@Kern_racc @FoxWithGuitar D:
Hell yeah ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž https://t.co/zTpQ8nyXNW

@topazdg ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
Someone on the enemy team knew i had a twitter and called it out and now everyone on my team knows im a furry :pensive: https://t.co/xgkQafmBPq
@FoxCobalt wait are you for real?  holy shit dw i can relate here :pensive:
A threat was possibly on campus as the police lost them near the school so they had to search the whole school.  But yeah im safe
The school ia clear now. There were police officers searching every room and i guess the person they were looking for kinda looked like me as they told me to step out of the closet with the other people i was with then said nevermind. Basically some person who was.. https://t.co/HIqEAWw19A
Im really worried rn. My school went from a code yellow to code red (meaning active threat on campus)  Idk whats happening and my phones about tk die
@FoxWithGuitar its out of place in many ways, like how everything has sharp edges, and this is all bubbly and rounded. plus that first image with the unnecessary of shine is also making it look wacky. and so much more. by itself its cool, not next to everything here.
@PoobyPatrol YO I LOVE THIS AAAAAA IFJ4JDIDJEJEID
Im a tutor for this ap calc class and the teacher played Rebecca Black's "Friday" on the zoom call  The class is now cursed and i hope everyone here now fails the ap test ðŸ˜©

YO I MADE THE OVERWATCH TEAM LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
@DestindHellfire @MarchioSheep @OWAnonymous_ Not only this, no whipshot makes a lot of characters hard counter her, specifically those that fly
@DestindHellfire @MarchioSheep @OWAnonymous_ It doesnt take skill to use it, but it takes skill to know when and how you should. Anyone can use whip shot to get some extra dmg, but it takes good players to save it for things such as people diving your zen for example. Or for moira, knowing when to use dmg or healing
@DestindHellfire @MarchioSheep @OWAnonymous_ Have some range OR mobility to make up for it. However, this rework would make her have neither
@DestindHellfire @MarchioSheep @OWAnonymous_ Its not about aim, there are heros like winston or moira that are def not about ain. Its about range. Winstons weapon, for example, may not be ranged at all but he has his leap and can go far really quickly. Moira has her orbs of damage or healing, which are ranged. All Ow...
@CEvandor why
@CEvandor Was this an english teacher?
@muttvore raccoons do be quirky doe
@Brave_Tsubasa Why tf you up at da quirky hour
@GiovanniFox12 I already sent him 0.0026 Bitcoin for his grandmas surgery, he is so kind
he asked me what the last four digits of my ssn are! He really does love me and want to know as much about me as possible ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
When he says he loves you ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³  and then he asks stuff like "Whats your mothers maiden name" and "In what town or city did your parents meet" you know he is a keeper ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
How the fuck are trump supporters trying to say that twitter is violating the 1st amendment   For a bunch of "patriots" these bitches literally don't even know how the constitution works plus probably think the first amendment means they can do literally anything lol.

@cokeypuffss I played alone lmaooo
@AceFluff Clearly you lack any brain power to infer that being made aware of something means someone found out and told them lmao, not that they are actively looking. plus they blocked you lmao, it looks like your the one stalking his twitter by actively trying to bypass the block.
