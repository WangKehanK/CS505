"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness."-- Mark Twain. #Travel.
Student, if the opportunity to do #research in your career presents itself, don't avoid it, EMBRACE IT. You will learn things you cannot now imagine. It will almost certainly take you to places in your career you were destined to go. #Meded                            #MedTwitter
I'll tell you someone I think showed TRUE greatness today. Pro golfer 86 year old Lee Elder, first black man to ever play in @TheMasters, accepted the invitation to be an honorary starter there today, alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. Too weak to swing, he raised his club.
I'm grateful to my @Stanford professors who taught me HOW to think, not WHAT to think.  I've met doctors who clearly had professors who only taught them what to think. When presented with new information, they are as lost as a mariner in a fog without charts. #Meded   #Medtwitter
My mom spent the last 5 years of her life in a #nursing home. She was the happiest person there every year. Her secrets: She ate the food she liked. Every afternoon she sat outdoors in the sun watching the ducks. She kept telling jokes; SHE NEVER STOPPED LAUGHING! #Humor     #joy
"Success is not final; failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts."-- Winston Churchill.
In the US, 300 to 400 physicians take their own lives each year. We are not going to begin to solve this until we get doctors back with patients, and spending &lt;2/3 of our time on the #EHR and admin paperwork. #burnout                           #physicianwellness
When I was a med student on my #medicine rotation, the intern and I were having a long night. The intern, looking at nothing, said: "I should have gone into #dermatology. Only 3 rules: If it's dry, wet it. If it's wet, dry it. Apply steroids." #Medhumor                   #MedEd
Before you Tweet, T-H-I-N-K-- Is it true? Is it helpful? Is it inspiring? Is it necessary? Is it kind? #kindness                          #KindnessMatters
Want the same care as your US senator? In France, Germany, and Japan, you would. Everyone's in the same nonprofit insurers. No managed care. No HMOs. No networks. No referrals. Short waits. Any patient can see any doctor. #Medtwitter                            #policy
I am now an older doctor. Most of my friends are also older doctors. Perhaps the only thing we can agree on is this: We don't regret any time we've spent with our families. We only regret all the times we were not there for them.
Thank you Dr. @andrewsuleh for your tireless efforts in Health Rights Advocacy.  You are a bright shining light. You provide leadership for Kenya, Africa, and indeed, the whole world. #healthcare                   #policy                    #healthpolicy
If you see a need in your department, university, or community, fill it. Think big. It can be something very significant. Be aware there will be people who are going to tell you why it is not needed. They may actually take action to stop it. Finish the job. #Service  #MedTwitter
"When we are young, #pain is the absence of pleasure; when we are old, pleasure is the absence of pain."-- An old #neurology professor. #Meded                                  #MedStudentTwitter
I was with a #Twitter newcomer, along with my 15 y.o. Goddaughter who rarely uses Twitter. The newbie asked "What does # (hashtag) mean? Me: "Subject." 15 y.o.: "Label of topic. Useful for people to cross-reference the topic to other users." I think our teenager bested me!!!
Make the decision to forgive everyone in your life. As long as you fail to forgive, you will ultimately find the person you've been keeping in prison is yourself! #forgiveness                         #Mentalhealth
The only constant in life is change.
"The secret in the care of the patient lies in the care for the patient."-- Francis Peabody, M.D.   (1880-1927) Prof. of #Medicine at @harvardmed.  #MedStudentTwitter                            #Ethics
Things I wish I could tell my 25 y.o. self: It's okay to make mistakes. The time to get a second opinion is when you think of it. Spend more time with nieces and nephews. If you're going to get married, be good at it.                You can't control patients' decisions. #MedEd
The words of US for-profit health insurance companies say it all. Any money they belatedly pay out to doctors, #nurses, and other #healthcare professionals they call their "medical losses." #policy                  #healthpolicy
I like the Twitter bios of all you students and residents who say you are a  "Rising medical student X SOM." I think better still are you who write "M.D., X SOM 2022," or "Neurosurgeon, X SOM 2026." In that way, when difficult things come your way, they can't stop you. #Meded
"Teach your mouth to say 'I don't know,' and you will be making progress."-- Maimonides.             (1138-1204) Jewish physician and philosopher. #Meded                               #MedTwitter
#TipsForNewDocs Congratulations on becoming a member of an ancient and honorable profession. You will never be a "provider."  That term was invented by insurance corps. so they could control the care patients get, their only goal to maximize their profits. Accept no denigration!
Have a Blessed #Easter! Jesus is risen. This is a time for new hope and a new beginning!
"A man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act."-- Mahatma Gandhi. #Easter2021
#TipsForNewDocs Traits I respect in a doctor: 1. Humility. (Keeps asking the opinions of others.) 2. Compassion. (No one cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.) 3. Integrity. (Does what they say they will do.) 4. Diligence. (Keeps working the problem.) #Meded
Patients are not "customers." The word "patient" denotes their highly vulnerable position, and they need people totally committed to them.
"A grief shared is a grief cut in half."-- Irish Proverb.
"We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give."-- Winston Churchill.
Can we really make a difference in this world? One man, born in utter poverty, from a bad neighborhood, taught radical love, forgiveness, and #equality for three short years. Today, Jesus has over two billion followers in every nation on earth. #GoodFriday  #peace           #love
I strongly advise friends around the world NOT to go the way of the USA putting private, for-profit health insurance corps. in charge of most #healthcare. It has been a Titanic disaster. #policy                      #ethics
To get the US to high quality, equal care for all we have to do some character and #values assessment on med school admissions committees. At the start of my med school, I said I thought all docs should see low-income #Medicaid patients. My colleagues: "Not me. Not my problem."
"Writing a prescription is easy; coming to an understanding is difficult."-- Bernie Siegel, M.D. #MedEd                                 #MedStudentTwitter
#TipsForNewDocs  We all have patients who won't follow advice; they continue self-destructive behaviors no matter what we say; When facing a life-threating diagnosis, they just say "no" to any treatment at all. We've got to get our ego out of the way. Getting angry will not help!
Student, you are going to need mentors at every time in your education and training. Some will be brought to you, others will appear at your periphery; If you want someone to be your mentor, ASK THEM. If they diminish you in any way, FIRE THEM. #Mentors               #Mentorship
Correction to last Tweet: First law of medicine= Primum non nocere= First do no harm.
#TipsForNewDocs  1. Never lie to patients, nor to anyone on your team. 2. First law of medicine= Primum non nocere= First do harm. 3. Put the patient first. 4. No alcohol when on call. 5. It's always okay to say "I don't know." #MedEd                            #medstudentwitter

For over 2,000 years, the doctor-patient relationship has been held as sacred. In the US over the past 30 years, profit-driven insurance companies have been allowed to invade it almost at will. The results have been devastating. #healthcare            #burnout             #Ethics
#TipsForNewDocs  If you are going into a specialty where you will be using surgical instruments: NEVER THROW ANY INSTRUMENTS. #MedTwitter
