@allstreetbets US
@brice_christine Yes! That’s basically the gist but stuff is going crazy now so the idea is to hold a few days even if it starts to drop because they are predicting a big spike. I’m not sure fidelity supports Doge
@brice_christine Your easiest option is robinhood, do you already have an investing account open??
@brice_christine Or Bitcoin !
@brice_christine Go buy some doge!! Lol
Idk who needs to hear this but go invest in #dodgecoin !!!!!!

I think every single person should be required to complete at least 1 year of college for ethics, statistics &amp; factual politics because the lack of education in my town is real 😬

@sophchristine31 That’s what I’m saying, like we literally buy the property for people who CANT like what we should just let it get taken because we can’t pay the mortgage?? 😅
@CamrynSue I was like.... dear, i am under no obligation to rent to you because i let you tour an apartment lol she was HOT. Some people are just extremely entitled
@CamrynSue Exactly. Thankfully the tenants we have now are all the best i could ask for, but.. that’s also because i made sure i took all the steps to ensure they were reliable people and could pay rent!! Some lady did tell me that because i didn’t rent to her she was calling her lawyer😂
@CamrynSue Malik works his literal ASS off so our properties can be nice enough that I’d even live in them. This is literally how we pay our bills. Why in the hell would i want someone in there without a stable job / knowingly can’t pay a steady rent!?
If you’re that bitter about landlords and renting go buy a house sweetie. https://t.co/hwkUw12aeV
