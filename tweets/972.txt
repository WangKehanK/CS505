Tip your Door Dash drivers! They’re out there busting their ass while you sit on your ass waiting for your food. The least you could do is throw two or three bucks at them in the tip section.

And they made sure to ban me before I could cash out the 260 dollars I made from my viral video. @tiktok_us  is a piece of shit app that bans creators so they don’t have to pay them.

@Cosmolax @theSupremeRk9s Rich people who donate to charity do it for the tax write offs and publicity.
@theSupremeRk9s I feel that but for different reasons lol

I got blisters on my knuckles from moving my mattress up the stairs... it took 4 hours to figure out how to do it. In the end I just used like 15 ratchet straps, folded it in half, compressed it as much as I could, and then pulled that motherfucker up! By myself I might add 🥲 https://t.co/Rgz3SNcDoz

@itboyjonny I was halfway to the gym the other day when I realized I didn’t have them. Leg day was incredibly dull...
Everyone shut up! I’m starting wandavision!
I had half a bottle of wine and thought I would need more. I then preemptively went out and bought another bottle of wine and opened that. I then proceeded to drink only half of that bottle of wine. Meaning I did not need to go spend $8.25 on another bottle. https://t.co/B3tzKtso5V

If I don’t like what they did with diamond and pearl for switch, I’ll just play platinum. Simple as that lol. It’s a “faithful” remake, so it’s gonna be the same game. It’s just gonna have uncomfortable 3D graphics.
Went back and finished my workout! Time to shower and sleep https://t.co/FSMdvaRCU9
