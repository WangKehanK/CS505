@haleyy_marieee_ As they SHOULD
Recently everyday has felt like the same day it’s almost like a routine at this point and it’s draining the life out of me
Something I’m slowly learning, don’t tell anyone your business they only use it against you
I did not know this existed I am done 💀🤣 https://t.co/jdWyF8RRcB
Good days on my mind
I love when my anxiety keeps me up all day and all night :-)
I will no longer entertain one way relationships, I’m too old to be doing that shit
I don’t know, I just feel like I’m out growing everyone and everything I need to get out of Radford FAST.
I love feeling nauseous 24/7 because my anxiety is so bad :-)
This video kills me every time💀😭 https://t.co/GfzQlD7GxG
“If you don’t like it then you can leave this country” KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY TRUMPIES💀💀🤣
@tannerdunc @lsizzlee_ Same💀💀💀💀
Some people are still obsessed with drama and constantly talking shit about you because they’re miserable with their own self, when do people finally grow up??
