@ProfofEvil @CoriMarie21 Oh my God there isn’t one. The whole paragraph is a sentence. 😭
NBC should have fired Chuck Todd *years* ago. Ugh. https://t.co/hNkZePR6KG
@RandyS0725 I go looking for you when the algorithm tries to minimize you!

@DCComicsGeeks Omen and Supergirl
@theAntiBinge @Marvel I didn’t know I needed this until you tweeted it. Yes, yes, OMFG I need it! https://t.co/fyUP62Dw1K
Promote a tweet, I’m blocking you. That’s it. Spend money to target my demographics on this hellsite, and block block block. Ugh. Promote someone *else’s* tweet and that’s a 2-for-1 special block. I hate this.
@CoriMarie21 @SpeelmanTom @themeganpurdy I wonder if I could find something about Kirby written by Mike Allred or Steve Rude I could just paste over TK’s foreword when I buy it.
@amadcartoonist Kate Pryde super-oops
@lesbianjubilee I mean, as a Bi in a relationship with a man right now, I’m still like “no, you know you don’t want that.”
@TheMutantMenace I will NEVER disagree with Betsy about the Phoenix.

@paigetheprncss Nope, just soreness for a couple days after. I got super tired that first day, though.
@amadcartoonist Senior Doggo + Baby is one of my favorite photo genres. ❤️❤️❤️
@JAMALIGLE Seems like it just got cranky all of a sudden

@CaptMarvelology Mary’s first look is still the absolute peak. Completely timeless, even the hair isn’t particularly dated!
Tony’s fixing of the damage done by Thanos, creating the blip instead of just doing the actual thing he was being selfish about and keeping his daughter alive and his and Gwen’s memories intact but rolling everything else back, was lazy and caused more trouble than necessary. https://t.co/sdVgirXkLI
Food, check. Water, check. Shower and clean clothes, check. Medication taken properly, check.   Guess it’s just a depression day anyway.  I’ll just be over here. 🙃
@Dragon_Age_Fans C and D flow from B, so I absolutely went with B here.
@danthemcmahon Soul Calibur, easy. https://t.co/9fIZrOAktd

Plagued by a days-long case of “But I Don’t Wanna”. Please just give me money and don’t make me actually do anything. https://t.co/YKLzlSGFKY
@amadcartoonist Mmmm. Moonstone, maybe?
@CoriMarie21 Uhm, me too. Listen, my Fiona Apple MegaMix doesn’t just play itself.
@teaberryblue Ok, Sweetums is amazing. ❤️
