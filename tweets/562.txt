@cliftonaduncan @ZubyMusic I use a Braun 7000 series shaver and Wahl shaving oil. I also have a good exfoliant but can‚Äôt recall the name at the moment (small black jar with white and blue lettering)... All great products!
A poignant article...  ‚ÄúIt is not about equality of opportunity, but equality of result. It is about redistribution or revenge justified by centuries of other people‚Äôs suffering.¬†‚Äú https://t.co/xPUaIgUFNR
@_BarringtonII Complete abdication and denial of personal responsibility
@_BarringtonII I‚Äôve read 70 of the 98 pages so far. It looks like a quality bill!

@_BarringtonII I‚Äôm a young, aspiring public servant from Kentucky. I‚Äôd be honored to take part!
@Robillard Cincinnati-Louisville-Nashville ought to connect with a detour from Louisville to Lexington
@EricsElectrons Rather than an evolutionary crutch, I consider human belief in afterlife the ultimate form of motivation for delayed gratification. What better way to influence how people act than to convince them (or yourself) that what you‚Äôre doing will beget a beautiful afterlife?
‚ÄúWhen a mind is raised, and animated by scenes that engage the heart, then those qualities which would otherwise lay dormant, wake into life and form the character of the hero and the statesman.‚Äù - Abigail Adams
‚ÄúIt is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed. The habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties. Great necessities call out great virtues...

@KentonHornbeck Make baseball great again! This would get bigger than all other professional sports
@StephenAtHome With the mass of lore and history in Arda, Tolkien wrote his books with a modern epic style reminiscent of ancient epic works like Homer‚Äôs. Did you try to consciously mimic Tolkien‚Äôs writing style in the films? If so, how? What lore and history would like to have included more?
@StephenAtHome Famous lines from the movies are often found in different parts of the books (i.e. Gandalf‚Äôs ‚Äúso do all who live to see such times...‚Äù). How did you decide which lines were powerful enough to use verbatim and how did you decide where would be ideal to place them?
@CaitlinPacific Things Fall Apart Great Expectations Huck Finn The Gulag Archipelago 1984 Crime ans Punishment  I think any three of these six would provide excellent lessons
@_BarringtonII I‚Äôm thankful my family has preached disciplined self-responsibility throughout my life. Even when events are not your direct responsibility, the humility, dedication, and initiative shown by taking responsibility for them is raison d‚Äô√™tre. We benefit from our neighbors‚Äô successes
@SAshworthHayes While we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs take  Alexander the Great and Attila the Hun out of our histories. Why should anyone ever study or admire the genius of the greatest generals in history?
@Ravarora1 @GadSaad I have to disagree. Gad is right. These shows distract from actually great half-hours like The Office
I‚Äôm stoked. This needs to happen! https://t.co/GCGxVhemoj
@lexfridman Since when is there an elephant in my room?
@_BarringtonII I admire your bottomless curiosity and indomitable positivity, brother. You‚Äôre an example to be followed!
@_BarringtonII generalize racism, abdicate personal responsibility (because only the collective matters), and condemn the individuals who refuse to be simplified and assimilated into the collective.
@_BarringtonII anti-racist, maintains an inherently collectivist worldview by focusing on how policies or institutions are racist or not, rather than how each individual occupies a unique position in the arc of human experience. To me personally, ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù is an opaque term used to...
@_BarringtonII According to their definitions, ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù contradicts with the idea of an individual and simplifies the world to a dichotomy of whiteness or non-whiteness, racist or anti-racist, evil or good. Most disheartening is that the flip-side of whiteness, which we can equate to...
@_BarringtonII Of being part of this whiteness. Yet, both authors and other like-minded people will readily describe some white people as not adhering to whiteness, some black people as adhering to whiteness, or any other combination you can imagine...
@_BarringtonII From my understanding of DiAngelo‚Äôs and Kendi‚Äôs books, ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù is less directly associated with having white skin, rather with an opaque culture and types of actions that are not anti-racist. The problem is that definition doesn‚Äôt work. It subtlety accuses someone white...
@KentonHornbeck I‚Äôve been there, over 24 hours in planes and airports. It‚Äôs a test of endurance! How bad do you want it??
@_BarringtonII Culture permeates every aspect of life. The hundreds of native languages for all people of the world express their cultural affiliations and values. We can not influence our society more than to change our culture
@LeonydusJohnson His works demonstrably changed my thinking. One of the most important thinkers of our time!
@_BarringtonII Here‚Äôs a great article by @Ravarora1 on statistical realities of cop violence: https://t.co/7tZ2cYunCC
@ConceptualJames America is constituted by individuals striving to figure out how best to work together, a country based on principles self-determination. If you can dream it, you can be it.

@nich_usde Be sure to check about the refund process for a security deposit and the terms for cancelling the rental contract. Also, furnished &gt; unfurnished 10/10. Utilities add up, compare and contrast beteeen apartments
@Ravarora1 @HeatherEHeying @sentientist @BretWeinstein I think it‚Äôs time for a full-fledged, scientific analysis and legal investigation into the motives. We need to figure this out for the sake of all young 20-somethings everywhere. The confusion is paralyzing!!!

@_BarringtonII I remember when my dad didn‚Äôt let me pick a hall of fame athlete for a third grade biographic writing. He upset me more than my small mind could express in that moment. In the long run, it helped me realize role models come in more forms than those we see often like on TV
Excellent podcast episode from @BretWeinstein with @jordanbpeterson! Learn about the war on competence and the abdication of personal responsibility. What‚Äôs different about you is what you bring to the world... https://t.co/jOxl0vdVTf
@_BarringtonII I‚Äôve moved to and lived in Germany twice in my life. Otherwise, I‚Äôve lived in different areas of Kentucky. From my experience, I say wholeheartedly that culture is the core, the most essential foundation upon which societies are based and they are more nuanced than most realize
@ConceptualJames @benshapiro What‚Äôs Gramsci‚Äôs neo-Marxist counter-Hegemony?

@rwsalzman I learned more from one of my final online classes at @nkuedu, which was normally offered in person, than I did from most of my classes (online and in-person) during my entire undergraduate. Quality preparation, teaching, and student investment can overcome the unfortunate medium
@_BarringtonII @NewEmergingKing Where can we find this podcast?
@Ravarora1 If you read White Fragility you would know that. Get with the times!...
@_BarringtonII I went to a high school that stressed its foundation as a classical liberal arts school. What liberal arts degree programs miss today is the grounding force of the classical, the discipline and hard-earned lessons taken from human societies rising and falling among one another.
The @nytimes article on recent, absurd treatment of administration and general staff at Smith College is a must read! Detailed are many disconcerting trends storming our society. https://t.co/ptPKo9zuEn
@_BarringtonII I‚Äôm on board! Like you said, he has earned a pedestal among the great and influential thinkers of history. I‚Äôm so glad to have across his works!
Read Shaw‚Äôs letter and watch her video. Her stand is courageous and an example we should follow. Thank you for writing this article @bariweiss https://t.co/S75WeHKkGe
Thank you for sharing this and stay strong, professor... ‚ÄúIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena‚Äù - TR https://t.co/p35iFxXPZg
@dudeischill @Ravarora1 @strxwmxn Completely agree!
I‚Äôve just listened to a snip of @jordanbpeterson‚Äôs podcast with @Ayaan. She has an outstanding mind! I‚Äôm happy there are people like her to look up to and excited to delve deeper into her works. Check out her new book, Prey: Immigration, Islam, and the Erosion of Women‚Äôs Rights.
@_BarringtonII ‚ÄúWhite supremacy‚Äù and other phrases that hint at inherent inequalities are heavy and should be used as such. When I hear it today, my ears perk up to hear whether the term is being used legitimately or a flippant accusation or description.
