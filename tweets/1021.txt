I married the love of my life yesterday and it couldn’t have been a more perfect day😭💕 https://t.co/6PJBX2vIl5
Our wedding is tomorrow. I’m so anxious😓
I’m so excited for Saturday. Celebrating our marriage with all of our friends and family even though COVID SCREWED us. And then a week away in the UP with my husband😍 @TannerTysick I can’t wait to marry your fine azz 😂💕
Having three weeks to move our wedding outdoors has been the most stressful thing but I can’t wait to be a Tysick💕
@TannerTysick 🙄 https://t.co/PPOiW5hdyt
@CheyenneTatman Thanks girl!
@CheyenneTatman Yes they are going to give our deposit back luckily... they had another wedding in two weeks that got cancelled too, which is the guys step daughter who has been helping us. So he is just as upset as we are
@CheyenneTatman We have over 150 people planning to come, and that’s what our plan is but we have to get insurance and find a tent and pray it doesn’t rain😭
@CheyenneTatman They were in the loaner car I had the day before I got my equinox... I have no clue where they could be... the dealership says they never found them but I didn’t clean out the car so I don’t know, and they weren’t cheap either😕
Our venue is no longer letting us have our wedding there...I lost my wedding shoes and I don’t know when my dress alterations will be done. Less that a month away from our wedding and I don’t know what else could go wrong at this point.
I got a weighted blanket as a bridal shower gift and I’m SO excited to sleep tonight 😂
@CheyenneTatman Yay!! Where at?
@CheyenneTatman You can always text me if you need anything!!
@CheyenneTatman Why isn’t he working right now? I’m so sorry!!
@CheyenneTatman I don’t blame you for not waiting around... I’m sorry😔 i wish you would come back full time
@CheyenneTatman What happened to coming back hereeeee
@JLAlford22 Yes!!!💕 I miss you guys 😭
Look at my cute little nephew 🥺💕 https://t.co/eHh0HU5wZO
