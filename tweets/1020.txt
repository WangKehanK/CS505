@_zeeali_ Hey queen 😍 basically I stopped using heat on my hair entirely unless there was a special occasion. On normal days I wash my hair and comb It in the shower to help loosen up my curls. Then after I get out I use these two products below on my hair and let it air dry!! https://t.co/eMkwgdzFMO

Really wanted to show my curly hair transformation ✨ https://t.co/ogZeAc50NH https://t.co/LVX6W9U1G7
