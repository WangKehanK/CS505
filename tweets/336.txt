@wydkeego W
@wydkeego fax
@Slim0thy I‚Äôve been his past teammate before on PS4 and he is the most useless captain i‚Äôve known. He made terrible decisions and overall led the team into the ground. He also let us do whatever we wanted which made us toxic. I would suggest that no one picks him up.
@PeterPlayzGame1 @sebasswagnergm1 @xQcOWUpdates smh -1
@CAFFEINEow I‚Äôve played it like twice maybe
@hiizuruu POG
@llDarkening @DanoIdam @BerkayShady313 @EricsLife__ @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates Getting mad
@WhippyNotPoopy Oh man you don‚Äôt deserve this. I‚Äôm sorry for the incoming bullshit you receive
@sebasswagnergm1 @xQcOWUpdates X is at fault for somethings but the cops did antagonize him and bait him.
@xQcOWUpdates Don‚Äôt blame PENTA/Wrangler chat. He was just the after result of all previous interactions.
@PatrickTheHung1 @Kacper12506051 @Vkhani12345 @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates yeah pretty ridiculous man if you ask me xqcL
@PatrickTheHung1 @Kacper12506051 @Vkhani12345 @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates X got out prison and came back. I believe X robbed Wrangler. Wrangler arrested him outside apartments. X then went to prison and did the usual malding. That‚Äôs when X got banned. It was a ton of build up to the situation. I may have missed some information.
@PatrickTheHung1 @Kacper12506051 @Vkhani12345 @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates lots of stuff to watch over but i‚Äôll sum it up. X got arrested today like 6 times. After the 5th time, X came back for his phone and lock picks. X got them and drove. Since X can‚Äôt drive he got arrested and charged with like 220 months. 1/2
@Officialj0nn @xQc ok then don‚Äôt watch lol
@DanoIdam @BerkayShady313 @EricsLife__ @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates Considering all previous events and the build up. I believe that everyone involved should receive some type of punishment.
@DanoIdam @BerkayShady313 @EricsLife__ @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates I agree with you but you know this man is addicted to RP atm. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù and he risks his mental health for the content so idk he should just prolly take a break from RP for awhile
@DanoIdam @BerkayShady313 @EricsLife__ @4yeee @xQcOWUpdates you would mald if you were in jail/prison for 3/4 of your day
@nehmee37 @xQcOWUpdates he got arrested like 6 times today and then he tried to rob Wrangler and now they‚Äôre going to raid his apartment
