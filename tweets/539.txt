@realDonaldTrump @FBIWFO This is why u don’t spread pics/vids of ppl with their faces visible
@TheSleiya Fun fact each New Years instead of dropping the ball, we drop the acorn
@erinshiflett Depends. I️ got offers for another camp but the pay was not worth it compared to my experience. imo the timing is right- I️ didn’t wanna not go but other job experience is important! Really just depends on ur goals.
Don’t spread BS. Peoples lives are on the line. Don’t promote looting because it can damage ppl lives- I don’t care about property. Crabtree and others are just malls that can be rebuilt. lives cannot.
Definitely is. But there is a police presence there just in case. https://t.co/hszoyNw18S
Granted I️ stayed in my car from a distance at night. But there was no activity other than cops in their cars. No, Macy’s is still intact.
Looting at #crabtree in Raleigh is bull. I️ live minutes away, and couldn’t sleep, so I️ went and saw what I️ could see. Cops with their lights on at every entrance, some blocking entrances to parking lots/mall. no signs of broken doors or glass.
