@shanedawson I haven’t watched James annoying ass since he was called out! Using his fame for sex? BYE 🗑🗑

@melbrown00 🤣💀
I’ll forever be a disappointment
@marleneshields7 It just instantly made my stomach flip! If I was him I would have snapped truly. He held his composure so well with everything he said.
Denise putting her hand up in front of Jeremy and cutting him off really pissed me off, like wow I haven’t felt my body feel anger like that. #survivor #SurvivorWinnersAtWar
@jaredmecham Gloves aren’t really the best thing to be wearing Jared!!
@marvelous_micah @survivorcbs They still show who everyone votes for it’s just after the “next time on Survivor”
@azzylinnn Ooo yes!!!
I’d say it was a good night. 🤣🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/yLJ2RZq6wr
@azzylinnn I don’t see how you could ever be considered anywhere close to toxic!!
Thinking ankle up 🤔 https://t.co/b7EmgxbpDj
@azzylinnn Hell no! 🤣 https://t.co/FjypHc01Dp
Watching my Benny today and most likely sitting my ass on Skype all day with my love!
Locked out of my main Twitter because it thinks I’m 13? 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣
@tillysartbox No pain at all for me!!

@nouraknowsbest1 Rooting for you!!
@caitelle1 I love it so much! 😍😍
@artbysal Okay if you need someone do not hesitate! 😂💜
@artbysal Damn are you okay after that? Uh right in the feels! 😂
@Mrs_ARockstar Y’all were petty and I loved it!!
