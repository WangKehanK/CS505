Why is it so hard for some people to be decent and kind humans 🙃
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness Ok babe
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness “You are a child” you’re in the same grade as me? You are a narcissist and your condescension is baseless and a ever-transparent reflection of who you are inside. Byeeeeee
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness I don’t need to concern you, an internet troll, with my morals. I also think that someone spending energy on letting someone know they have “annoyed” them is the most pathetic and genuinely sad thing I’ve ever seen. I wish you good luck babe
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness Wow I guess mental health matters until it inconveniences you huh. Anyways, I think it’s evident who is genuinely projecting here, as you couldn’t mind your own business in the first place. Have a good night though, babe 🥰
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness I stood up to my friend who you are attacking for no good reason. I have morals and no matter how long ago it was I’m always going to stand up for my friends. Maybe you should learn something about being a kind person and a nice friend and then come talk to me
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness How old are you?
@justgabicherron @her_hoeness Hi Gabrielle! I’m gonna kindly ask you to stfu and mind your own business! I know her personally very well and you don’t know anything lol isn’t that crazy! Take care of your own problems before worrying ab others!!!! Xoxo
