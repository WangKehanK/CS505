FUCK GONZAGA
GO BRUINS
College refs are fucking trash
LeBron either need to keep the ball in his hands in the clutch or just let AD do his thing
Why the hell does Vogel call a timeout with 1.7 seconds left but not call one right after getting that last rebound

Bron need to start giving the ball to AD in crunch time
Make your fucking free throws Bron

You don’t have to meet someone to have a meaningful connection with them. I grew up watching Kobe play ball all my life. He was the epitome of greatness. To me he was invincible on and off the court. RIP
I can’t move. I don’t wanna do anything. He wasn’t just a basketball player. Kobe was my hero. He was an icon and a legend. He made me fall in love with basketball. RIP Mamba
New Mac Miller album is a vibe
Never doubt hard work. You put in the time and you will see the results
Nothing like seeing hard work pay off
Everyone expects Kuzma to be scoring 20-25 points a game when LeBron and AD are taking such a huge chunk of the teams shots
At least let me go to Coachella with my girl before I get drafted
@nenae89 We were all waiting for you to come back from that walk lol
@MyNamesNot_Rick In LA or in the bay?
Yo wtf was Rondo thinking
Don’t mess with Dudley

@nenae89 Lol thank you! 🤘🏼
@TheHollyGoon Java Fusion all day
Lmao AD just called Porzingis “little ass boi”
Everybody on the pelicans playing their best game of the season tonight
My girl is the best
I can’t take you seriously if you grew up in LA and you’re a Clippers fan (just ask my dad)
I think I’ve liked that video of Kobe and Lebron dapping up about 10 times
DANNNYYYYYYY GREEEEEN
Staples is still Kobe’s house
Lol everybody praying and going to church this Sunday
Follow God, Closed on Sunday, Use this Gospel, Selah
On the Orange line. Dude is pouring a mikes hard lemonade into a Powerade bottle. Not even 10 am yet #TheValley
Lol the hate is real for KCP
BASKETBALL IS BACK
no team is stopping Bron and AD
My moms favorite thing to say to me as I’m walking ou of the house is and will always be “Donde vas”
Lmao these tyga and Kylie memes about to take over the internet
Yo Jared Dudley is low key hilarious
