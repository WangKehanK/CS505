@belieberx2369 omg same i always want to walk after work but it’s always dark and i look like a dude and don’t feel safe 😂😂
i stg my body goes through a ritual every march to destroy and prepare a new me for spring. this is the 3rd march in a row, always the 2nd week in, i just get slammed with the flu or flu like symptoms, die for a week, and blossom out of my grave for spring to officially start
seeing everyone’s snap stories enjoying the nice weather today is killing me 😭
the first week the weather is nice i am waiting for covid results and quarantining 😭😭😭
@KdotGoff happy bday single kyle 💕
where i thought i’d be at 25 and where i am at 25, is extremely disappointing 😞
my friends absolutely amaze me, i am extremely lucky to have such supportive and caring people in my life and i truly do not know what i would do without them ❤️

@GarbagePlate585 alot of my friends are servers and i’ve heard their horror stories and how many times a night they get stiffed so i go a little crazy with tips 😂
@GarbagePlate585 i get what you’re saying but if i’m going out to dinner especially on a holiday, i’m tipping my server more than 20% especially if the service is good 😂
@GarbagePlate585 LOL well when you’re a server at applebees, you’re lucky to really get tipped at all some nights so 😅😂
@GarbagePlate585 that’s like barely 20% and that’s before taxes and drinks 😂
after 9 years, @McDonalds has finally recognized me 😙 https://t.co/3kidKQcTfZ
me on my way to my 6am shift https://t.co/VW5IlpqKPg
if my gf is working at applebees on valentine’s day, u guys better be tipping more than $5 on your 2 for $20’s 🙄
@belieberx2369 dm hot mama 😉

nothing enrages me more than driving down Lake Ave

@HVRanch @yung__father better make your own custom bottle
it’s funny to me how people will read an article about 1 person dying after receiving the covid vaccine and be anti-vaccine but, half a million people have died in the US alone from covid and those same people still think it’s a fake disease, make it make sense pls 😭
@OliviaRWerr i do not expect much fun out of it at all 😅😭
anyone want to get their master’s degree with me? no? i understand.
so, who do Bills fans root for? the Chiefs or Tom Brady? just asking for a friend
lmfaoo i’ve been just WAITING for someone to post about this 😂😂 https://t.co/M1T7tYJY2D
@ParkerCasselman @mikesully958 i didn’t say bill fans were bad people 🤨
@ParkerCasselman @mikesully958 well my fan base donated to your quarterbacks grandmother so maybe you should think about the Colts then 👀
i think i am the biggest anti-bills fan in western ny and im okay with it
i will FOREVER hate the Buffalo Bills solely based on their fan base alone
@sb___jr @Lianetsy_Ramos https://t.co/Kyt52oDPKd
the ravens have always been irrelevant in my life until tonight
@sb___jr @Lianetsy_Ramos 3-3 😘
i should’ve asked @belieberx2369 for a Raven’s hat before i went and watched the Bill’s game tonight
@belieberx2369 i am officially old
forgot to share that mine &amp; steph’s cat had 3 little kittens the other night :-) https://t.co/7oNqcuyVbv
@belieberx2369 @KdotGoff oh like me and @DackJiamond destroying you guys in pong 😉
how do i tell everyone at my job that i am not a man just because they only see my short hair and hear my deep voice on a webcam 😂😭
@stephpassero die
if the Colts win today, i will get a horseshoe tattooed onto my butt 😭
i had to see it for myself and i live for it https://t.co/2pcuBFopr0
