But fr they didn't cast Shannon, a regular from another cw show, just to hang around the claw on nancy drew. I assume his character is going to play a much bigger role, but will it be as part of the drew crew orrrr ?
Excuse me @TheCW I need @SHANNONKOOK as a part of the nancy drew crew for real

@TheAffinityMag I would assume this scene would be one of those playing-homage-to-the-original in some quirky way like Riverdale did with that one scene having the gang in their 50s comic outfits. At least, I hope.
@griffxnblake I'm assuming this scene is probably them forced to dress up for some reason but it's primarily to play homage for the viewer, ya know what I mean? Like when they put the Archie gang in their comic book clothes that one time, that type of thing

i'm just so sick of the older actor/younger actress dynamic in hollywood. they are both great but it's a 15 year age difference, 37/22. I feel like it really fucks with our interpretation of ages and how old women are "supposed to look" by hollywood standards. https://t.co/J3loEHleRh

It looks like they will debrief alternative timeline Loki about what happened in the original timeline, which I'm really happy to see. I loved his development arc so I'm glad this Loki will at least be aware of it, &amp; that it won't be completely thrown out the window in the show. https://t.co/bXm5GuCVtQ
@Lesdoggg Absolutely.
