The university of Houston should move to the SEC  Natural rivalry with Texas A&amp;M Can compete off the bat in baseball and basketball Would dominate football recruiting

@Chinchillazllla This also applies to nations
@donKeedic88 @LukeBraunNFL Final note: Jefferson is very likely to have a less productive season next year but still lead out of these 3 because DEN may not have a QB and Lamb is still behind Cooper. Jefferson could regress with MIN having worse Oline play a healthy Thelin and defensive improvement
@donKeedic88 @LukeBraunNFL Had poor quarterbacks and Lamb doesnt receive the target share Jefferson does. This isn't to say lamb and juedy do everything better than Jefferson because they dont but Lamb and Juedy are still better overall players in my opinion but it's close. (2/2)
@donKeedic88 @LukeBraunNFL Jefferson is very very good but progression isn't linear so to expect him to produce at the same or a higher level next year sets you up for failure. He could be a better player next year and not get targets or something of that nature with Juedy and Lamb both (1/2)
@LukeBraunNFL 9 teams don't CIN and LAC got QBs WFT got Young TB NYJ CLV all got franchise tackles SF needs Kinlaw and wouldn't utilize Jefferson properly DEN and DAL both got better receivers
@PFF_Mike Trevor Lawrence to the Jags at 1, Mike you're a god-damned idiot
Because military tech has far surpassed guns the amendment cannot actually do what it is intended to do.
The second amendment was put in place to insure that the citizens within the United States of America would have the means to rebel against the nation if the nation exceeded its power.

@TFG_Football Theoretically couldn't a suit make it easier for Houston to save face when he leaves the organization. Not saying this is some grand conspiracy but cults do weird ass shit.
@AllbrightNFL As a Busby in Houston I would like to clarify that Buzbe is a complete different family name and oh god twutter is going to be a nightmare

@TFG_Football Dupree is a clean up guy, he's C+ in all areas. Clowney is a C- rusher and an A+ run stopper at the end of the day they grade out the same just in different ways. There's a reason Pitt is going to roll with Highsmith and a rookie(maybe) next year.
@TFG_Football Bud Dupree isn't a good player. Clowney doesn't rush the passer at a high level but he dominates the run.

@Chinchillazllla Im gping to say there's a chance he has no idea what this word means, I say this because I had no idea what the word meant. That being I'm smart enough to not say words I dont know the meaning of but I'm hoping he's just an idiot and not a monster

@coachcodutti Determination, if you aren't willing to do what it takes why should I?
@PFF_Sam Can you use your ultimate system to track which tackles since 2006 have had the toughest assignments? Based on the grades NYG's Cameron Flemming seems to have had the toughest assignment this year but I'd be interested on a piece on who has had the worst luck one on one.
@QBFilmRoom I feel the same way about dline prospects
@TYHilton13 Can't wait for him to join the texans secondary like the rest of your sons
