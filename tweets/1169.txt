@alenamc31_ @1PHILHNDRXX_ The hospitalization rates for vaccinated people is very low lol
@alenamc31_ @1PHILHNDRXX_ Are you not reading? The vaccine isn't currently designed to stop you from getting the virus. It's designed to fight the symptoms and keep you out of the hospital
@alenamc31_ @1PHILHNDRXX_ Based on?
@alenamc31_ @1PHILHNDRXX_ Because the vaccine is designed to help fight the symptoms and keep people out of the hospital.

@DragonflyJonez Why are we paying attention to a man with "conquered Indian Land" as his location?
She got Pixar mom physique
@JarredLikeTacos That doesn't make him overrated. That just means he was never on the best team in the league, for whatever reason. Using team success to judge a player's ability is reductive and stupid.
@JarredLikeTacos Let's go with 07/08. Averaged 21/12. 1st team All NBA. 2nd team All Defense. And Kobe getting the MVP CP3 deserved.
@JarredLikeTacos Idiotic
@NuoImperialista @HOUSEOFDEVI Why?
This and these be fucking y'all up lmao
@pbeohm1 Yeah you're crying about the reactions to 2 different situations lmao
@pbeohm1 And Watson has had endorsements either drop him or suspend him lmao. Keep up that weak ass victim mentality tho
@pbeohm1 And I haven't seen a peep about Allen but keep seeing people call Watson a "serial rapist"
@pbeohm1 Well for 1, the overall point is wrong lmao. 2. You can't insult people for pointing out your mistake lol.
@pbeohm1 That's not what you said at all lmao. You called people idiots when you're the one that made the mistake lmao.
@pbeohm1 ?? You called him a serial rapist. How is that not saying he's guilty?
@FrankTenVoorde @engadget It is
Aye hold on now https://t.co/VMflJ2K5z1

@whatawhale @klew24 Harden has had a true shooting% &gt;60 since his 3rd year.
Why is Burger King quoting Lil Wayne?????
@whatawhale @klew24 The only example here that applies is Iverson. Both KD and Harden have been hyper efficient for their entire careers. Russ' playstyle and skills just don't make an efficient player.
@trizzythagod @DVillain910 @DragonflyJonez Y'all must be young as hell lmao
@EricNineOne @DragonflyJonez Don't let Pusha T see this tweet
@whatawhale @klew24 He's never been an efficient player. Tons of turnovers and consistently below average true shooting
@fullof_secrets It's not even worth it lmao. Let their internalized homophobia eat away at them lol
I'm fucking burnt out
@ItzVonzTweet @levinsor @vianesavargas @NuitGod @rutledgecharle1 I'd recommend reading this. You can skip to the part that explains how there was already research to build on if you want https://t.co/yvaoOAzisu
@ItzVonzTweet @levinsor @vianesavargas @NuitGod @rutledgecharle1 They went through trials already. What the fuck are you talking about
@mo4lo @NuitGod @blacc_awakening Please explain how it's stupid to get this vaccine
