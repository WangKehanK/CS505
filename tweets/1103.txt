@Cull_TheBoss No one has ever had a harder time watching sports than you
Never fly into JFK airport it is run by absolute idiots
I hope the MLB Allstate game is moved to Cali or Texas so 30 people can go
Moving a baseball game because of stupid opinions about something done completely legally is insanity
@savagevegan Can you pay with crypto
@CultureCrave A sin
Plan for Thursday Step 1: go to hour long class Step 2: go see Godzilla vs Kong in theaters by myself because my roommates have jobs

Having your employees come out with sexual harassment allegations is a weird way to stop the news from covering you killing thousands of nursing home patients

Two types of people in this world. Those that understand the need for gray Adidas slides and those that don’t https://t.co/qKRlFWquVy

@Todd_R11 Coles brother eating 12 eggs??
@NYGovCuomo This is what happens when you vote blue. Your state gets absolutely fucked and I cannot believe people are backing this fucking clown. Cuomo and Deblasio are the only reason new york is so screwed right now. They let their small businesses get ruined.
@NYGovCuomo I cannot believe this fucking schmuck says this now after spending the last 8 months letting his state get ravaged by covid all so big meany in the oval office gets hurt. What an absolute fucking joke.
Man, for both sides of the aisle, if your answer to not getting what you want is to destroy shit and destroy the country you live in you are a piece of shit
