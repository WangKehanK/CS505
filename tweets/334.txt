@NakedByo @The_Sky_Z @DanceOfJesus1 Don't talk about video games unless you started on pong. Idiot. See how much sense that makes?
@NakedByo @The_Sky_Z @DanceOfJesus1 You doubt it? Lol. Been on since the first Xbox early game access. Keep trying though.  You're upset, and an idiot. They make role play servers for people like you.
@NakedByo @The_Sky_Z @DanceOfJesus1 This isn't the original mod is it?. I'd like to play for interaction as well but the game isn't so these days, that I know we can both agree on. I don't only play on modded servers lmao, we own one and play official. You must think every modded server is boosted beyond belief
@NakedByo @The_Sky_Z @DanceOfJesus1 Honestly you're in denial. The official game only consists of build, raid and pvp. Very little of the population actually plays the survival aspect. Dayz and rust are no where near the same game aside from being survival. Move the goal post a little further next time.
Follow the light, the light is your guide.
MFDOOM Was one of the greatest lyricists to ever walk the earth 👏
@NakedByo @The_Sky_Z @DanceOfJesus1 Not necessarily, you gotta expand your environment. Weekend raiding is good, discord is good for the game, no one likes to build for weeks just to be raided the day they don't play🤷
Shit ain't like it used to be
@The_Sky_Z @NakedByo @DanceOfJesus1 Myself and three others are currently building a community server, we're trying to make a true dayz experience.
@DanceOfJesus1 @DayZ I miss the original game, all funky and broken. But honestly the current state of the game, bugs aside is amazing. I honestly wish that I just now got into it, broke but good. Colors are vibrant, they're plenty to do. Adventure awaits imo. 👌🍻
@JavarEscobar Definitely not going to flop, never knew Gm will manufacture it, they got one of them zero emissions goals. Wouldn't buy but tbh it doesn't look half bad.
@Minerva4K Both ways
Does anyone have some foamposites that they beat the shit out of? How have they held up?
The internet made all of you hoes. Offended by name calling 🤣 taking that he her shit to the grave. I'll call you whatever you're acting like.

@BeantownJae @KingJuice731 @KingFloyd999 @wolfkhyre @KeepDatShit100 🤝🍻
@BeantownJae @KingJuice731 @KingFloyd999 @wolfkhyre @KeepDatShit100 You're right man. Let's shake hands and learn from this going both ways
Problem is and will be, uneducated firearm owners (legal or not) with a disregard for the safety of those around them.
Painful to see people in possession of firearms without the proper knowledge of how to handle one in the first place
Fuck ah vaccine
@campeon_don A different approach indeed. Seen many videos but doesn't compare to my game play experience. By feel, game is sound. Was bummed out, Bases everywhere, shitty player base (expected), and the lack of space between encountering another player. Every altercation but one was hostile
You don't know me

@trialsofb Really a wide variety of avenues where you get can into. Never thought much of anything like this when I was a kid
@Minerva4K @MoonWitchLynx Been on, where you been
@stunnindisaster Is that by any chance where plaster pours into the grand? Or where is it that the water is that high?
