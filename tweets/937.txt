I couldn’t figure out wtf my cat was chasing around the living room so I’m trying to catch up with her and it was a fucking wasp that she (I think) tore the wing off of somehow??

@sweaters4ever @jordyn_nichelle Is it like a Marshall’s thing for the building to be freezing? Every time I’m in the back I feel like I’m in Antarctica
@edgarallenhoe99 No girl I mean like outskirts of town, like near Harlan and stuff! It’s technically still fort wayne but you can find a 3bed 2bath for like &lt;90k in that area! It’s insane (not ALL the houses, you still gotta look a little)
@edgarallenhoe99 Have you tried looking outside of Fort Wayne’s limits? There are some really nice places down in Indy that I literally fawn over every time I drive down there
@fat__kyle Literally same, if I’m on FT with someone they can hear them so well they think someone else is in my apartment
My favorite thing to do on Instagram is bookmark fitness videos like “yeah I’m gonna start doing that” and then never looking at my bookmarked videos again
Anybody wanna buy a cute ass black corset that I bought? It is too small for my chest and online returns are a living hell 😬

TBT when my bf of almost 2 years literally said this to me about going to his best friends wedding. AFTER I had my nails and hair done and put on a pretty black dress and heels :) + “I mean you won’t really know anyone, &amp; I won’t be able to babysit you.” Lmfao https://t.co/nTOGmO6aDd
I don’t watch the online exams for Psych I just took exam 2, and got an 80.  The only questions I saw that I missed were lecture specific like “in class we talked about x, what did I say was stupid about him?” I coulda had 100% if I just listened to the lecture 😭
Hoping it’s because she beat his ass. https://t.co/SrnwdIEH5x
Tbh Snapchat is how I text, aside from work stuff I think I’ve only given my actual number to like 2 people since high school lmfao

My moms favorite thing is bringing up my ex’s and asking “what ever happened to them” almost weekly
An (older) man just said “I’m not even rich, I’m not poor but I’m not rich. I’m worth about 3, maybe 4 million, ya know? That’s just not really a lot” to MY FACE and he was SERIOUS  I wish I was kidding

Me “ugh it’s 330am I’m so glad I finally finished that paper, I’m so tired.” Also me “gets in bed and immediately gets on Twitter”
@mroseporter I love this so much 😭 you guys are so cute it cracks me up
Why do I read thread comments on tweets describing what “not all men” means when I just KNOW I’m going to get mad.

I absolutely fucked up; I decided to stay up and finish a paper tonight (that’s due tonight) and have been like preparing myself to stay up.  My dumbass has work at 8am and did not factor that in :)
@fat__kyle I like them look at the little cows 🥺🥺
@edgarallenhoe99 Actually it’s wild because our generation seems like everyone’s have kids, but that’s only because with social media we’re really connected. But pregnancy rates are crazy down from the last few years, even with the quarantine babies
Like a year ago at a restaurant a guy literally handed me $500 in cash and said “because you’re pretty.”
Idk why I set appointments with my advisor so early when I know I’m up all night and I’m going to struggle getting up for it 😭

I can dead lift &gt; my body weight but I can’t even bench 1/2 my body weight and that really frustrates me tbh
I didn’t realize I ran out of cat food until it was too late and now my cats are acting like they haven’t eaten in 3 weeks
@russhole21 Hear me out; Colorados cost of living is a little higher than ours, but their minimum wage to rent cost is way better than ours.
