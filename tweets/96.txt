@TheRealEWILLZ I’m ready when you are😂
@HBCUfessions That you her roommate
@HBCUfessions I get what you saying but it could have been handled differently. Just because she didn’t love you the same way you loved her doesn’t mean the friendship had to be thrown away like it was nothing n
@HBCUfessions You focused on his/her past as if you a perfect saint. If they clean and weren’t with ya whole school that’s all that matters. Folks be mad at the past and messing up they current
@HBCUfessions No one forced you to spend the $40 on her. It’s a great thought and gesture, but y’all not married either. Personally, I’d only do large gifts if they been showing the same efforts from jump or if we married. I don’t expect a man to spend that much on me anyways

@HBCUfessions I meannnn you already on the verge anyways
@LakerGangDay Oh wait damn nvm I’m late asf😭
@LakerGangDay 18
@lovejfrancis And i bet as SOON as a white person say the opposite thing y’all gone have a problem with it. Oops I’m sorry, i forgot y’all not ready for the convo on how black people can be racist too🥴
@TheeDreadGod 😂😂this is definitely me on all social media
@Guts_Glam_Glory 🤦🏾‍♀️y’all got problems
@kimikogreys Bruh some of black twitter some hypocrites frfr 🤦🏾‍♀️
What irks in the black community is that folks will bash a black man or woman for wanting to be with a white person but AS SOON as a white person bash they friend for being with a black person it’s a problem🥴
I’m just waiting to see what word y’all gone hype up and act like it’s brand new come 2020
@xoxo_daddy All that*
@xoxo_daddy I mean yeah but my 9.25 and budgeting ain’t allowing all tha good
@HBCUfessions Sooo....you must have gotten a scholarship or sumn cuz wouldn’t you have loans too?
Nah fr cuz i see folks 21-25 posting similar stuff like huh?? How can y’all be in school full time, pay your own bills, car notes ANDDDD by all this🥴 https://t.co/0NYN4rrX2H
@poetonthelow @HBCUfessions I frfr just searches through all the posts to find it and here it is in the freaking comments wow😭
@HBCUfessions LMFAOOOOOOO WE GOT A WHOLE RESPONSE😭
@HBCUfessions It took a turn when you said fucking professors for grades
How my neck feels after my outta shape self took the stairs cuz the person I’m walking with took the stairs https://t.co/QoOgRT7VVV
@thekillakay_ Lmfaooo folks arguing as if everybody had the same teacher😂 Some folks were taught to go left to right and others were taught to according the order of PEMDAS
@kalebt232 Sorta kinda. It’s better to just say you’re single bc you’re free to do what you want. I just say don’t talk to multiple people because then you’ll be hurting others in the process of you choosing who you actually want to commit to.
Awwwww congratulations!!!! I’m so happy for you!!🥳💜 https://t.co/IxxfAQVwdj
@HBCUfessions Me scrolling tryna find the ones in my city https://t.co/QqAMOWOy72
@HBCUfessions She does have a right to make that choice, but sex isn’t just about the woman it’s about both parties. She should have better communicated why she felt that way out of the blue. Then again we don’t know if this was discussed before and he ignored it until now either🤷🏾‍♀️
@HBCUfessions It means he need to breakup with you cuz clearly you don’t feel the same about him
@_Daminator Tuh no. Time in prison ain’t shared by folks. My time is up now he gotta serve his.
@kalebt232 Yes. You have the title of being single HOWEVER, this doesn’t mean talk to multiple people. If asked, you can’t say you’re in a relationship, you say “I’m seeing someone”. If y’all not on the same page, don’t claim you’re dating someone cuz that’s how you get hurt in the end.
@HBCUfessions You started it now go finish it and tell us how his wife and kids feel
@MrrRighttNow It makes it better when they start making bets
@JeremiahLanez Yes☺️
Nah fr😂 https://t.co/1innWCqEFb
@blackmagick__ 🤓
@200reggie You have no reason to apologize. You did nothing wrong and if folks have a problem with it block em because they don’t care about you. I’m so sorry for your loss😔
Y’all don’t understand how mad i was when I couldn’t do this https://t.co/wwUaqr6G32
@HBCUfessions Why is it a problem he want to sell lashes? It’s clearly a profitable business idea that’s in high demand among our generation
@HBCUfessions Sooooo because y’all not sexually active it means y’all can only be friends? Y’all haven’t even made it an official relationship. Why not appreciate the fact that he respects you enough to not do sexual shit while not in a relationship. Ooooooh y’all irk me🤦🏾‍♀️
@HBCUfessions Why are y’all so proud of being straight ignorant?
@LaMayaa_ None because you had to type this tweet😂
@xoshiy Lastly, every culture has appropriated another culture and made it their own. Black people have appropriated other cultures as well but you not ready to have that conversation
@xoshiy I never said that other cultures do not appropriate black culture. If the original post i was replying to is referring to white people, why would i bring up other cultures when it wasn’t talking about them?🤨
@xoshiy How you gone try to defend the black community but use a word that totally disrespects the black community? Please make it make sense
@xoshiy 😂i deleted it cuz i ain’t feel like arguing with you cuz what i say won’t change your mind and what you say won’t change mine. The fact you want to say “you sound like a coon” deadass contradicts everything you’re trying to say right now😂
A lot of people in the black community don’t think they can be racist because of a definition but they can be and it’s toxic asf
@dijoni No we are not going to ignore that but clearly I’m talking about the women who are not forced to do such things and simply get their hair done that way simply because they want to. Have a nice day😌
@xoshiy Did i say it was exclusive to white people? No i didn’t so don’t put words in my mouth. Oh, and you have some nerve calling me and others ignorant when you don’t even know the right THERE’RE***. Have a lovely day in Jesus’s Name😌
@dijoni But it’s okay for black women to get straight lace fronts and wigs? That’s what i don’t get about the black community. We get mad when White people do it, but yet it’s not a problem when we do it
@HBCUfessions Y’all just wanna justify cheating which is toxic asf. If you feel she gone leave anyway why not just cut ya losses instead of cheat dumbasses
@chachachanise Can i just ask what started this? For you to start recording? Was the assault before the video or doing the video after the phone fell? I’m genuinely asking.
@Daryanna__ @JerseyMcClendo1 I get what you saying which is right, but that’s just how life goes in general whether you in college, just starting your career, retired, unemployed, etc. Life moves on and time still passes by no matter what. The clock keeps ticking 24/7
@HBCUfessions First you need to focus on school cuz ummm “loosing”...“loose”?? Second of all everybody and they mama know that “figure out who i am” means “i wanna be a hoe but i don’t wanna cheat”
When i tell you i rolled off the bed laughing😭😂💀 https://t.co/GUsquxYCrm
@HBCUfessions This took such a sharp u turn
@HBCUfessions It means whatever tf he told you damn you in college and ain’t learn how to comprehend?
@HBCUfessions I get what she saying. Everytime i tried to break up with dude he would guilt trip me into staying
I thought all gas stations sold alcohol😗 https://t.co/vheJOkuF6g
@SaycheeseDGTL I see what they was going for but honestly that’s a mockery to the homeless community. Real homeless people don’t have those bags to sleep in, clean jackets to wear and cushion to sleep on. These people were given supplies to sleep there, the homeless are not
@HBCUfessions So you had NOWHERE else to go after you were locked out? What did you do once you woke up? Did you leave? Did y’all continue with sexual activities? Did you stop him or did you just let him do his thing and enjoy it? I have sooooo many questions
The truth!!! https://t.co/hm8UjYjVMH
@HBCUfessions The fact you even questioning this shows that she deserves better than you. If you see that she trying and not being an outright bum, be there for her and support her. Consider why she’s getting her GED and didn’t finish hs. People deal with shit that delays education.

@HBCUfessions Ain’t no way this is real. Folks be saying weird stuff on here just to get posted
@HBCUfessions You already know that you tryna let him get you pregnant because if you weren’t you would either 1. Wear a female condom or 2. Make him wear one or else y’all won’t have sex. He told you up front. You acting like he sending mixed signals
@HBCUfessions I’m just here to see if any relationships start out of this
So...you want a relationship....without the commitment. https://t.co/KS32MeKM9j
You got fucking problems https://t.co/rJ0iD3AU57
That probate was long as hell. Number 49 whewww chile i feel bad for the girl at the end. Her voice box okay? https://t.co/zDqgK1sTkD
@1tailedbeast @HBCUfessions Girl i would shout out my boyfriend if i got up to 20 likes 😭gone do ya thang girl
@HBCUfessions If y’all strictly friends why are y’all cuddling....at 3 in the damn morning?! If he strictly yo friend why would you give him head? Smh some of y’all need to go back and learn elementary vocabulary cuz um....that ain’t the definition of friend
@MagnumJackson I’m reading the comments and some of y’all counting the decorative pillows that y’all toss to the side when you go to sleep.....cheatin asses y’all have 5 not 36
YESS😭😍 https://t.co/JICI4obSUP
@somesayju I get what you saying but i would say don’t let it scare you. 1. We’re not in the ocean and it’s not something that would come up to get us because if it could it would have by now 2. The same way humans get scars, animals get them as well
Exactly and in cases such as this, just because they’re your ex doesn’t mean you can’t show support for their family in a time of need such as these. If he still in contact with his ex on a respectable level, be a nice human being and stop tryna control his life. https://t.co/SB9oWyTC3n
@SuppleSweet Purple cuz i used to loved math in high school but it’s been demoted to blue since I’ve been in college😂
@MrrRighttNow Most definitely
@blackmagick__ For majority it doesn’t but there’s a lot of people who it has worked. I know a few people who are now married and found they spouse on the app
😭not even 7 https://t.co/9JpB52GnSz
