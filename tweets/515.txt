@DonVeedal I’m praying for your parents and your family. I’m hoping they have a speedy recovery 🥺
@_sallimonchile Girl, yes!! It’s super good &amp; it comes out all crispy and crunchy. I’ve made some pizza rolls in it or even tiny taquitos lol. We also cook our vegetables in it with a little bit of olive oil and pepper!
@_sallimonchile Definitely potatoes and garlic bread. It’s beautiful 🥲 we made our stuffed bell peppers in there too and you should 100% try it 😭
@_sallimonchile You won’t regret it! We use ours all the time!
@_sallimonchile I’m crying into my Harry Potter bookcase with all my HP crap on it 😂
@_sallimonchile WHAT. IF I HAD KNOWN- 😭😭😭😭 I would have made you watch them years ago 😭😂
@SolElenaQ Do you have a gofundme or anything?
Me and my coworkers are watching the livestream of the inauguration at work 🥲
@I8YourSoul Happy birthday! 🥰🥰🥳
@I8YourSoul Ty 🥺🥰

@pitaaa1013 I wanna say it’s because other countries didn’t make listening to scientists and doctors a political issue 🙄
The anxiety and fear I am experiencing is even worse than it was the night of the 2016 election. The amount of disassociation my mind is trying to put me through is concerning me. Lord help us all.
It doesn’t help that none of us are Dodgers fans in my family except for my dad so he’s really thriving right now 😂 I’m never going to hear the end of this.
I’m 100% sure my dad is back at home poppin bottles right now since the Dodgers just won the World Series, that man has been waiting for that team to win another WS since my brother was born and they played against my team. 😭😂
@stacetheeace And I’m like “if you know then why are you doing it????” https://t.co/xljUvyXV01
@stacetheeace The amount of times I’ve had to tell customers they can’t do this is astounding. People are so clueless 😐
@_chrisjerick 😭😭🥰
@_sallimonchile I haven’t texted my dad because I’m 100% sure he’s at home poppin bottles right now especially after that first inning, my god. I was shocked watching the game thinking ”Y’all still going?!?! Relajasen, por favor, there’s still 8 other innings!” 😭😂
OH DON'T GET MY HOPES UP LIKE THIS, I HAVE A WEAK HEART.
I knew there was a reason why my phone decided to fully break on me. It didn't want me to suffer with each notification of this A's game. That being said, I still love my team and I'm proud they made it this far.
@JynnBBy @kendraaaleighh Oh my, super adorable!!! Look at that tiny nose 🥺🥰🥰🥰
I almost had an anxiety attack-  As soon as I walked into this place I made eye contact with this dude who looked exactly like a toxic person from my past &amp; my first thought was “omfg he found me” my fight or flight said ✨fight✨ but at 2nd glance I realized it wasn’t him. 😭😰
@JynnBBy @kendraaaleighh Oh my gosh!!! What kind of puppy? 🥺
@JynnBBy @kendraaaleighh That’s so cute!! ❤️ We’ll be hitting 2 years next month but no kids yet! Maybe we’ll get a dog when we move in together in a few months 😅
I’m ready for the amount of stress this game is going to give me. No matter the outcome, I’ll always be proud of my team. @Athletics #RepTheTown
Happy birthday @DillonFrancis !!! 🥰🥳🥳 There’s no one else I’d spend close to 2k worth of merch for over the years &amp; no one else I’d make a pickle sign for. 😂❤️ https://t.co/SJ2ExSTE0f
@Goodvibessliz @ArianaGrande I’ll have to do it later today when I get home from work! Thank you ☺️
@Goodvibessliz @ArianaGrande I don’t even know how to figure this stuff out, girl. I don’t know what this sun, rising, and moon stuff means! I just see it everywhere 😭😭
@kendraaaleighh Me reading this thread while already dating a software engineer 👁👄👁
@sukkahfreeSAV @pitaaa1013 Honestly though 😭💀

The White Sox put on a hell of a game, I need a beer for the stress the game gave me. 😂 but for the love of all that is holy i need my A’s to beat that wack ass team next week 😭
Holy shit @Athletics had my heart pumping 😭😭 here we goooooo
I turn into such a baby when my boyfriend goes back home after coming to visit me. I’ve been sitting on my bed for hours just hella sad because I miss him even though he was just here. 😔 January can’t get here fast enough.
