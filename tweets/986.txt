#MentalHealth is a battle that a lot of people do not take SERIOUS enough! I know because I suffer from 3 illnesses myself.. sorry to hear about #DMX and Drug addiction never needs your judgment.. we are all fighting SOMETHING! 💔 https://t.co/YlS3gKqTEv

I don't care what anyone thinks? Stay at home moms also need a break, especially when they still have toddlers. "FROM WHAT?" Do you not realize how hard it is being a Mom, a Woman? If you don't agree trade places with a hard working Mother for 48 hours!! HMmm

@derrick_shavers WTF? My pipes are frozen to my house .. Dallas county south of Little Rock! If you are not here no need to comment.. someone died a few hours ago trying to travel in this shit. I see nothing funny? We will get over 7 inches before Thursday (Snow/Ice)

I've been off of Facebook for over 6 months, loving the peace! When I need a good laugh all I gotta do is open #Instagram or #Twitter.. but I gotta say my favorite place has become TWITTER hands down 🤣🤣🤧🥴 #RawAndUNCUT 😎
This new year has already been a mess in so many ways and it's only JANUARY. I don't have any predictions or expectations of anyone including those in power, like the president. But hopefully by the year 2022 we can be at least 50% back to normal? #COVID
ARTISTS are some of the most troubled and tortured souls you will ever meet. Likewise to those who are talented in general.. that pressure to be great doesn't always produce diamonds ❤
WHEW 2x https://t.co/eXSmCyBirw
I thank God that me and my 2 sons made it over into 2021, so many did not. But as a MOTHER I watch, pray, and stay vigilant keeping them safe! I will not live in fear but so many people are causing the deaths of others.. #MaskUp #Covid19isReal #SAVEALIFE

Those that seem to be STRONG can be fighting the roughest battles in silence. For 6 long years I have had my struggles with my mental health due to 3 different diagnoses. Add to that the death of my Father, Mother, and my 1st Baby 💜💙❤ #WorldMentalHealthDay
