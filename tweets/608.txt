36 hours later ~ sore arm! That's all!
28 hours later ~ unbearable migraine
18 hours later~ horrendous headache that got better with Advil!
7 hours after ~ hallucinations, confusion, felt like my muscles were being ripped off my bones, chills, no strength, nausea, couldn't stand up, felt like the grim reaper was in my room
6 hours after ~ body aches started. Began to feel weak and unable to stand up. Super lethargic.
Prior to 6hrs after ~ no pain at all. Not even a sore arm. Went to work (resturant) and felt totally fine
My J&amp;J Vaccine experience!  (Gonna make this a thread)
@AyaanicBond #vaxxed
Northerners at OU are chuckling rn
I love Mad Catter üíÄüíÄ #BattleBots
@BattleBots Huge v Mammoth was one of the best fights on your show
@BattleBots Definitely disappointed. Hydra never once fired it's weapon. Perhaps the score sheet should be changed. Huge was the only bot to land a real hit. Was looking forward to this fight until I saw the hydra attachment. Most boring fight ever.
Honesty,  i never want to watch #DWTS again. Horrible ending.
Unfortunate that the fact that the equipment manager SHOVED A CHILD moments before is being looked over https://t.co/oS8zhP0XpX
You forgot the mention that the same equipment manager literally DECKED a child just moments before this https://t.co/SKJeCqtZwb
#sooners https://t.co/4IrMEQXd8U
With @aj_mclean and @skaijackson gone, what's the point of watching #DWTS anymore
I am junior in my fall semester at University of Oklahoma's School of Meteorology. I know I look tired
@dunkindonuts please open a Norman, OK location
@JeffreeStar On my way
@amylaur So glad you said this! Sorority sisters won't let a post online ruin the future of their sister ‚ô°
@biancarenaelim As someone in a sorority, I will say this is comparing apples &amp; oranges. Posting something could really be damaging to your image and ultimately hurt in the long run &amp; im glad my sisters watch what I say online. And I will wear a mask to protect those sisters nationwide ‚ô°
@JeffreeStar $KaitlynGant Is and forever will be a JSC fan
@JeffreeStar This would help a college student so much ‚ô°
@starwars If you bring back Rex just to kill him off, I will be passing away for personal reasons
To the girl who got in the accident in front of Varsity House in Norman today around 7:50am.  I hope your week gets better love

If this is the man behind coronavirus, can't we just go to Iego to get the root or something? https://t.co/LZgGU9JjYo
@bmloveofficial He got the copyrights for this palette long before this pandemic started. The palettes were already being produced when it all started. He had to release the palette or they would all expire. No one could have predicted this. Please don't attack him over this.
@swordmaiden13 Are we really being THIS sensitive over the NAME of a palette? He keeps saying it's a GOTHIC fantasy. The word cremated fits perfectly into gothic culture. If it bothers you so much, don't buy it. He'll do FINE without your business :)

@AyaanicBond As someone who's mental health has been at an all time high this semester, two weeks is very detrimental
@JeffreeStar @Wendys Jeffree!! You should try that foundation hack from tik tok!
@JenMonnier the chorus to Achy Breaky Heart with the ooooOOOooo is also 20 seconds :)
Apparently hand sanitizer is selling out everywhere because the coronavirus threat. Luckily, I was one of those bath and body works hand sanitizer girls in middle school.
loud eaters need to be banned from public spaces
