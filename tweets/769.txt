@realshekinahh If dems can raise millions of dollars and votes gaslighting problems that are almost nonexistent what reason would they have to actually try and solve ANY of them. Serious question here. I don’t understand how ppl can get played over and over again
@Uber_Support I had a 30 dollar promo code for first time use of the app. I tried ordering twice and both times were cancelled, no delivery no charge. On the third time I actually got my delivery but when I tried to apply the promo code it didn’t work for me.
@kimslayyss @DoniTheDon_ @stuntlikeb You should be more ashamed that you’re grown and illiterate.
@shellsncheezzz Ask if you need a ride
@EukayBrie Wow 😍
@EukayBrie I consider myself great for many reasons. Race is far from being one of them. Anyone who reverts to race to define their “supremacy” really ain’t that supreme at all. Ijs lol 😆
@Tiara_Talks Totally true, and it’s not a book smarts thing, it’s a common sense thing. A lot of life’s struggles can be avoided by making the smart decisions that dumb people can’t help but making.
@Mel_Coffman I vote go with whichever way you like best, because you look absolutely stunning either way 😍
@Creiz Exactly right. I still remember when I was a freshman my teacher walked out. We didn’t have a home room teacher for weeks lol
@Creiz Totally feel you there. Everyone in the ghetto suffers. We need better schools, good employment opportunities and a reexamination of certain aspects of our inner city culture
@Creiz @EukayBrie Don’t for a second think only black’s are raised in “ghettos”. We face the same bs you mentioned only we have a target on our backs be the locals think we’re soft. I’ve seen many of my friends (including myself) wounded or killed and it’s rarely ever at the hands of “white man”
@TheSourKnight @stillgray It’s not about child or not. It’s called the law. Understand it moron
@TheSourKnight @stillgray Because we agree. Where we don’t agree is that any responsibility falls to the guy in the video. She could have easily walked away like I said before, problem solved. If she felt egged on she had every opportunity to walk away, no excuse to become physical, none. Point. Blank.
@TheSourKnight @stillgray No you’re not getting it. Free speech is in the 1A . It doesn’t matter if he said “I hope your mom dies and burns in hell” it’s no excuse. “Egging on” is totally objective to those who feel “egged on” so you can’t hold people responsible for that. Speech is protected not actions
@AmericanAbroad5 @IAmMonique16 Pence totally crushed it didn’t he? I was worried because I knew he’s a nice guy but he really did well v Harris
@DoniTheDon_ Always have been conservative. Mama raised me that way, but just became political in 2016 when I started seeing so much hate from the left and digging to find out why. Idk if I’ll ever understand the thought process of a liberal, especially when they cancel anyone who disagrees
@kirstiealley Asking a liberal to “look deeper”is impossible to them. Hell, it’s been hundreds of years and they still can’t see past skin color. There is something really mental with these people
@TheSourKnight @stillgray People like you are the problem. It’s his fault for “egging her on”? Give me a break. She could have easily walked away and let him get to his car. She had no right to become physical or throw a dog at him. When you start blaming people for “egging on” it becomes a slippery slope
@stillgray She sounded like she was on drugs. Kudos to him for not snapping out on this psycho. She she be charged for her actions for kicking him and for throwing that puppy
@Lkeesher22 @DrShayPhD I don’t think you were watching the same debate. Sorry to hurt your feelings (not really), but Harris got dominated hands down from beginning to end
@greggutfeld Pence dominated the entire time and did so with class and composure. Kamala was wayyyy out of her league
@DoniTheDon_ Same here, but I feel like if I was old enough for regan I would have supported him too. Something about alpha males who tell it like it is and fight for American values
@Joy_Villa @Mike_Pence He so smooth reminds me of James Bond or someone lol
@themilowrites That was actually pretty funny 😂
@DrShayPhD Pence is going in, and he’s cool as a cucumber while he’s at it. Love it
@DrShayPhD I didn’t think he’d be tough enough but so far he’s winning. I’m just saying lol
@Ysunflowergirl @bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Of course he doesnt. Liberals don’t even blame protesters or rioters or looters who don’t wear masks. Only rally goers or synagogue attendees
@Ysunflowergirl @bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Was that the ppe that somehow wound up in a warehouse in jersey? Dems are so irresponsible
@bjakelly @larryrstreet @AntiSensor2nd @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Again it’s totally up to local elected officials. Here in Pa you have to wear a mask just about everywhere that’s open. In other states it is different. Are you starting to see how this works now?
@bjakelly @Ysunflowergirl @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Better question: what did you want trump to do knowing that local elected officials are expected to do their jobs and govern?
@shellsncheezzz They’re pulling out all stops to try and steal the election. If Biden was a good candidate or his policies weren’t absolutely insane, they wouldn’t have to resort to such dirty tricks. Even hardcore dems know Biden and his policies are a joke they don’t think he can win
@Ysunflowergirl @bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump That’s all they do. It would be easier to list the things, if any, that aren’t trumps fault in their eyes. It’s really a shame
@bjakelly @Ysunflowergirl @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Absolutely false. He was serious about it early on while the dems were busy with their sham impeachment. They were downplaying is saying “come to Chinatown”. When you’re a leader you don’t cause mass panic. He literally said it was serious but he didn’t want to cause mass panic
@Ysunflowergirl @bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Exactly. I honestly think the dems are mad that these policies are from an outsider and they didn’t think of them first. Notice how they never attack his policies unless it from an emotional viewpoint. Other than that it’s ALL ad hominem
@larryrstreet @bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump So true. And I don’t even care about whatever they call me. I’m used to it. But I’ve been with my girl 8 years and I love her. I hate what people say to her. she’s a strong hardworking woman who is leaps and bounds ahead of those who insult her, in every way. It pisses me off
@larryrstreet @bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Exactly. Every election cycle and it gets old real quick. Where i live I’m the minority even in my own house my gf is black and my kids all mixed. But every time either one of us says anything against the narrative, I’m all of a sudden a racist and she’s a coon.
@DoniTheDon_ The Republican party was created to fight slavery and racism. It's a shame 166 years later we're still fighting them. Same fight new plantation. Sad part is the dems have learned to gaslight. Just like the great Mrs. Tubman said, she could've freed 1000 more, if only they knew.
@tjlevi32766 @Heidiv58 @McguireScotty @realDonaldTrump Same here, Dauphin county
@McguireScotty @no_silenced @realDonaldTrump Exactly why I'm taking my happy ass to the ballot box personally
@shellsncheezzz Dude, she really isn't lol. 😂
@kirstiealley Hi Kristie, hope you're having a good evening
@bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump The problem you have is you hate Trump so bad you desire him to be at fault for everything. You have to understand the blame that also falls to the local levels. 40% of all covud death are from dems mishandling the virus when they put covid patients in nursing homes. 40% is alot
@bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Sure let's look at Florida https://t.co/btlIWET6YY
@bjakelly @larryrstreet @AntiSensor2nd @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump You can't use old treatments on new viruses. Why do you think there are flu vaccines every single year. How come we can't just use the old stuff? Because every single year is a different strain
@bjakelly @larryrstreet @AntiSensor2nd @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Like you don't know Drs are being silenced. You should open your eyes.
@bjakelly @larryrstreet @AntiSensor2nd @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Problem with that theory is that is been already stated by Drs who hate Trump that the travel ban saved hundreds of thousands of lives. What doesn't save lives is stuffing covid patients into nursing homes. I should know. I live in Pa https://t.co/OWpqeM7mV2
@Freedomrings22 @StacyOnTheRight @JoeBiden Well you know, according to Biden, "unlike blacks, Hispanics are incredibly diverse with different attitudes and opinions on things". What a clown. 🤡
@jorgan10s They really are. Here's a few reasons I think why. They're smart in general, beautiful inside as well as outside, they aren't afraid to be feminine and don't hate us for being masculine, take better care of themselves hygenically, they have a grasp on their emotions and much more
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh no! 😂
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr You're not my type. I like strong conservative women. Not 50+yo liberal lunatics with lots of metal in their faces trying to "stay hip"
@jadescleaning4 @LATiffani1 Haha good luck. I've been following tiff for awhile now. You're gonna have a hard time convincing her she's oppressed or patronizing her. Move along to the next one, Karen 😂
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr My ignorance? You're completely ignoring the fact so many people are telling you they don't expierence racism or oppression and you're saying you know better than them because you had black neighbors in the 70s. Who is ignorant? 🤡
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr Well. I guess i cant complain. You never claimed to be intelligent. Go find another black conservative so you can claim they're oppressed. Maybe you can save them with tour whiteness 😂
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr Saying since you had black neighbors you know more about racism than people who live in their skin everyday. Dont be such an idiot. These people are clearly telling you they're not oppressed. They are strong enough to speak for themselves. They don't need you to patronize them
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr it's not even just him. You're attacking every black conservative you see trying to claim they're oppressed when they're telling you to your face they're not. That's downright insulting. You should shut your ass up and take a backseat on this one. Take your fake outrage elsewhere
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr Get triggered all you want, Karen. Call me all the names you like. That's what liberals do. I'm not surprised. The fact still remains you're here telling a black man who grew up in the deep south, slightly post Jim Crowe, that you know more about racism than he does.
@breadbin68 @ZubyMusic China for creating it and letting it escape, also here are just a few responsible https://t.co/IDffnh9pnU
@theangiestanton @LoveCovfefe2020 They also support SB-145. So if children survive late term abortion, they have to deal with SB-145 and LBGTQ+youth, hopefully they live in a good area b/c D's oppose school choice, if they survive all this maybe they'll be lucky enough to attend one of their indoctrination camps.
@marklutchman Haha nice tweet 😁
@thejtlewis @ComfortKem @realDonaldTrump So any liberals claiming this was taken out of context, here's your chance. Please explain to me why it was necessary to inject race when Biden could have simply said "essential workers"? Are POC only capable of menial tasks? Are there no non POC stocking shelves? Plz explain.
@hiukwongl @nathanael_gould @ZubyMusic Those who keep claiming Trump is responsible for all the deaths or he should have done more simply do not understand how our government works. What are they teaching in schools? I learned this in 6th grade in 1996
@JoeBiden How about trying something not new and put a lid on it
@mrglenn @debbiealm I know a few people personally who've stopped watching simply because they're tired of the hate, and they don't necessarily like Trump. You'd think something is wrong when a man nominated for 3 Nobel peace prizes receives nothing but 100% negative coverage.
@Godly_Artwork @taitt_m There is alot worse pics than this one out there, lol. You can tell alot about a person by looking at the behavior of their children. And when I look at Ivanka vs this young lady here, there is absolutely NO comparison.
@Pink_About_it @VFL2013 Great tweet 😁
@DoniTheDon_ That's the equivalent of me leaving a job interview early, staying only a few mins each day of orientation, and then claiming once I'm actually working I'll be the hardest worker in the company. It makes no damn sense to me, and tbh shouldn't to anyone else either.
@DoniTheDon_ The man has been calling lids at 10am the entire campaign. If he can't work to earn the votes of the people, what makes everyone think he will once he's elected?
@DLoesch Very few of said elected officials were doing their jobs BEFORE covid
@bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/uE76wFhGK9
@bjakelly @AntiSensor2nd @larryrstreet @BevMahone @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Try to understand how our gov't works if you plan on making political posts. Trump sent out the guidelines, against dem wishes he also enacted the travel bans. It then falls to local gov't to enforce said guidelines, many of which were handled horribly b/c "it's hip to resist"
@TLewis43758 @ChristianWalk1r I also prefer my heroes not captured. I hope they make it home in one piece. I'm also happy Trump has brought thousands of them home in just this way, preventing more American bloodshed caused by rediculous, endless wars.
@ChristianWalk1r It's also a huge insight into one of the major failings of the education system
@jeffreyb100 @robsmithonline @froggyradio Also disregarding non POC who performed essential services. As you can see it's simply easier to not pander and just say "essential workers"
@jeffreyb100 @robsmithonline @froggyradio He could have easily said "essential workers" the left tries to make everything about race for two reasons: to pander, or to divide, both they assume gets them votes. By doing this not only are they insulting some by insinuating POC are only capable of menial tasks but
@Purrrfect8 @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Obamacare is a disaster. Myself along with everyone I know have real good healthcare through our employers. We don't want to change that and we don't want our tax money to pay for insurance for criminals who come here illegally, so....no thanks.
@TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews The Republican party was created to fight slavery and racism. Who would've thought 166 years later we'd still be fighting the same battle.
@HermitPJ @DoniTheDon_ I know exactly what you mean. My son is also an online gamer when he's not playing outside. He likes roblox and was telling me about one of his friends and was like "this kid, well he's not really a kid he's an adult.." I was all over that like white on rice.
@Tiara_Talks Amen. Liberals are always angry and living in fear. This is why they'll never grasp the concept that there is a difference between surviving and living. What a sad existence.
@benshapiro The very thought of an alpha like Trump being alive offends their sensitive emotions. I wonder how many of them cried themselves to sleep tonight.
@EricA44295511 @donaldsangel This idiot clearly doesn't understand the difference between tax evasion (which is illegal) and tax avoidance (Which is smart). What a loser. And has nothing to do with the original post, lmao. WTH Karl.
@erichirshberg @hrenee80 Did she not endanger anyone when her and her buddies were saying "come to Chinatown, it's fine". I guess you're the type that also thinks Trump is responsible for all death and Cuomo handled it well. What a moron
@TheDamaniFelder The kids who would strike out at kickball are back now, and with a vengeance. Damn angry betas
@gunneybones1 @DoniTheDon_ So true. Exactly why they block school choice. There literally is no other reason to keep children trapped into schools that are completely worthless. Keep them trapped in the hood, keep them on welfare making just enough to survive but make any more and lose all benifits.
@Tiara_Talks Covid didn't stand a chance. Trump is a machine!
@reelpat215 @McKaylaRoseJ Welcome to the family. There is alot of love over on this side bro. Glad to have you
@DaClementMusic @aoirthoir @Cj7jeeps @McKaylaRoseJ Love how you post a video of another libtard bugging out in a video. 😂. Seems to be alot of those going around, what you won't see are videos of conservatives acting like angry toddlers throwing a tantrum. Just a bunch of Karl's/Karen's with a severe lack of emotional fortitude
@RichardGrenell @daninbluemd @GavinNewsom I got 3 sent to my address here in Pa, but come hell or high water I'll be at my polling place in person. Can't trust the USPS these days. It's sad
@jadescleaning4 @HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr The ultimate white privilege: when a white lady from Illinois tries to school a black man from Georgia on what racism is. Claiming "he doesn't understand". You can't make this shit up folks 😂🤣
@dan_J94 @maloy123082 @hodgetwins Imagine getting triggered by a car ride. One where you don't know anybody in the car, outside the car and you're not even in the area. Keep crying, Karl. I bet in real life you're softer then wet cheese, ain't ya, snowflake?
@dan_J94 @maloy123082 @hodgetwins Calm down sparky. 1) He did a ride by to show thanks to those that were there supporting him. 2) He has the same healthcare all presidents have. 3) it's not republicans that are keeping the country closed or stuffing ppl with covid into nursing homes, so shut the fuck up moron
@AOC Which member of Congress, or elected official has obamacare? Please feel free to name one
@jenn_zamer @seanhannity Let me bring up Trump in a tweet that has nothing to do with Trump and then claim the author of the tweet is the one deflecting. Not very bright, are you. Do you know what a hypocrite is? Google it.
@seanhannity Watch all the libbie morons scramble off topic "orange man bad" I guarantee you NONE of these Karls/Karens will address the topic of the post. LET THE DEFLECTION BEGIN! 😂🤣
@DoniTheDon_ The part liberals will never understand is that when you create positive change that effects people's lives, you don't need to pay them. This concept is lost on liberals because democratic leaders only look out for themselves so they have to pander and pay for support.
@Brixea @pam_sands @KittyLists Looks like Tiny
