@Steveharveysbi You’re right https://t.co/b7EFy8t6Ie
@lastlostgirl_ Lmao honestly!!
I’m smart and good at plenty of stuff. Can anyone tell me how I manage to *always* buy the wrong lightbulbs?????????? I have never purchased the right lightbulb on the first try!!!!!!
@fannahhox I haven’t been sick in over a year. I’ll be keeping masks as part of my seasonal defense against cold &amp; flu, no doubt.
Why does #54 look like a younger version of @1cerebraldad???? https://t.co/TUCbQGc62r
@Ashley_Marcoux I’ll subscribe!!!!!
@Ashley_Marcoux Waiting for you to start streaming, especially so I can start living vicariously #TooScaredToWarzone
@ChronicHoosier That confetti was the slowest confetti I’ve ever seen
I just feel like @AariMcdonald and the rest of the Arizona team deserves this win. #ncaaW #NationalChampionship
Let’s go Arizona!!!!!! #ncaaW #NationalChampionship
My partner just called me by my name so I’m single now!!!!1!1!111!11!!!!!!
I still think the Wat Shot™️ (I’m biased) is better but this was still a thrilling end https://t.co/qi2SAsJ0Ch
@mariah_mathey97 My dad’s feeling pretty confident that Baylor can win if they play like they did tonight.
I wanted UCLA to win but that final shot? Wow!! #NCAATournament #FinalFour

- She has 2 cats and 1 dog, I’m about to have 2 cats move in with my 1 dog and me  And now, we both have dark blue kitchen cabinets 😂  (This isn’t an exhaustive list, just what I can think of rn)
Y’know, as the years go on, there are more and more strange coincidences between @harto and me. Here are some examples:  - We’ve had similar haircuts (I swear this has not been an intentional choice lmao) - She has a cat named Charles and we have a dog named Charlie  (Pt. 1)
@tarajoynow One of my favorite shows!!! I bought the DVDs but now that it’s streaming, I’m v happy 😊😊😊 https://t.co/riYaxXLbzm
So @Kehlani’s video for The Way has 79 million views and I’m pretty sure I’m responsible for about 78 million of them https://t.co/4k5XTdH4bx
Had my first eye exam in 4.5 years and my eyes are dilated so I'm over here like: https://t.co/algNUomNRX
But can you imagine a @tyleroakley Twitch stream of Among Us with @gracehelbig, @mametown, and @harto? I think it's highly unlikely but I'll continue dreaming of it 🤩 lol
FINALLY 💉 https://t.co/4Aq0NN3GkQ
@kat_apillar The creepy part about this tweet is it’s something a ghost could also tweet #murder
(Maybe I'm the only one but I'm hoping we can all get on board with *not* referring to @IndianaWBB as the "girls basketball team" or the athletes as "girls" by the start of next season)
Still proud to be a Hoosier ❤️🤍❤️🤍 @IndianaWBB https://t.co/0OfTYwp8FX
Watching someone jump at the free throw line: https://t.co/1RIKndqxV4
This Baylor / UConn game https://t.co/Wq8kUnIASx
Considering how much I watched these movies and The Mummy movies when I was a kid, there was absolutely no hope of me ever being straight https://t.co/WGL6B60HZM
@__kayleebrown https://t.co/UuTJgJ1pWm
@__kayleebrown One of the best movies ever IMO
Dana Evans from @UofLWBB is on FIRE tonight! I’m mostly rooting for Oregon but I’m always happy to see someone have a game like Evans is having tonight 🏀🔥
@cordouroydreams @kat_apillar That’s what I said too!
@apparentLeah I cannot STAND Twitch ads

@yungnorwin They really are terrible I’m sorry to tell you that
@cordouroydreams @Steveharveysbi Hey y’know, I don’t have a ton going on that’s worth snapchatting so https://t.co/UctqqCQzd3
@st3vi3_ts @kat_apillar Lol thanks! My dad’s coming with me so I’m pretty optimistic. Plus I said I’m not bringing cash so
@kat_apillar Idk, I’ll have to wait and see if I survive this meeting.
@st3vi3_ts Lol I’m getting ready to head to a stranger’s house to look at a couch so I sent @kat_apillar all the info and they were like, “paranoid???”
@cordouroydreams I love you and the daily vlogs you provide via Snapchat 💚
Told my partner a ton of info on the person I’m about to meet up with for a FB Marketplace transaction and they said I was maybe being a lil paranoid.  So anyway, I’m single now 🤷🏼‍♂️!!!1!!111!!!!
