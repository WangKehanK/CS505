@DatOlToonie it‚Äôs an executive dysfunction thing but most people w adhd have that so yeah
@thebestiespod any suggestions for similar games that dont involve the actual hunting aspect for weenies like me who feel real-life bad for killing fake monsters?
@OhNoPodcast spotted a rythmia ad out in the wild (the wild being tumblr)! obviously the safe part is disputed, but would you agree it was luxurious? ü§î https://t.co/JqrwzXeb5N

is there a way to disable ‚Äútopics‚Äù or whatever they‚Äôre called. the things where twitter just puts random tweets on your feed. can you get rid of that or what?
@Viiperfish lenny i love you!!

@starrthepj would you mind sharing a link? i have mild aphantasia and the suspense is killing me
redesigns are fun and cool. response art is fun and cool. drawing over/editing an individuals noncorporate art is neither fun nor cool. that‚Äôs the end of my opinion.
@thebestiespod @RussFrushtick @plante i don‚Äôt think i saw anyone else ask this, so ill go for it: thoughts on the newly announced pokemon games (sinnoh remake, arceus legends, new snap game)? are you looking forward to any of them? any apprehension? etc.
@rosiebuttoncups @thebestiespod @RussFrushtick @plante so i think they‚Äôre either referring to handheld games that you can do while on a treadmill or a bike machine or whatever, or else they‚Äôre talking about stuff like ring fit or vr games that have a lot of timed movement
after getting a good drawing tablet and program at the same time ive started looking at every single piece of digital art i see and going omg i wanna learn how to draw like that over and over again
