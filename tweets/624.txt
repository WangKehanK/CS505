@KidCudi these beats go dummy
@coach_frost if Ohio state plays Texas A&amp;M leave this shit hole of a conference they call the big ten. It’s full of money hungry pansies that would rather drag down a program that’s asking the same thing as a program that, sure, has more wins but we both have the exact same goal.

@MikeFroehlich2 @korupteddonkey @Sean_Callahan In the winter less people go to games because it brutally cold up here in November. It’s not like Houston weather in the fall when the temps perfect. I would know I’ve lived in both places.
