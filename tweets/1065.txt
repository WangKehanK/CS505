School has me so burnt out fr I’m dying

@Skyduck64 It actually would slap if you muted michaels last line 💀
The fact my college is only doing a virtual graduation :/ At least it’s not my 4 year school, but still sucks 😕
Remember in 3rd grade when teachers told us we’d write essays in cursive for the rest of our lives like why’d they lie that hard💀
@lophiile Classic WoW! Best content in the game’s history is re-releasing in a couple months
If you haven’t been searched for by campus public safety at least once, are you even having fun at college
@wearetheempty Hopefully Warped Tour makes a return and I can see y’all on that 👀
@JoshManuel Boyfriend but originals? Made To Last is the only song in the discography that I sometimes skip so probably that one

@noahfinnadams It must be said tbh
@luvrchl Mark and Lexi 😪
@ajbends I’d like to think I’m good at art every so often.
@yasminesummanx “How did I get so far from my yesterdays” OR “arrogant boy, love yourself so no one has to”

@noahfinnadams We’re quite literally brainwashed from a young age to believe this. It took befriending an English kid at 14 to realize it wasn’t true, some people never have their eyes opened
@Juhsuwah I can’t believe I’m seeing pewdiecry fan art in 2021 I-
In 2021 can we leave behind shaming adults (women especially) for their body count and simply just ✨ mind your business ✨

We have a LONG way to go and Biden is by no means the perfect answer but I can relax a little bit 🙌🏻
We were sobbing out of fear and y’all laughed at us, will never forget that shit https://t.co/bJ1Srp4XQN
We had to deal with 4 years of being told we’re overreacting to our literal rights and protections being taken away so NO, Trump supporters get no sympathy from me if Biden wins 🤷🏻‍♂️
Sooo what time does the civil war pregame start?
