@itswacc If you ever want reccomendations for RG kits, just let me know- i own basically all of them XD
@ToksanAlpha I believe she's done this before- she'll be back, probably. Can't blame her for wanting a break tbh
Besides that though, forgot to mention yesterday- got the frikkin' vaccine yesterday finally!! Took a year &amp; 1/5 or so, but idk. Just happy to have that locked down
No thoughts, head empty, only Dynazenon ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ https://t.co/1Nd5achJ6X
December's IBO LET'S FUCKING GO https://t.co/7jogkAP1po https://t.co/W83RSE0mmN
The Lance(s) are coated entirely in metallic red paint, it looks REALLY good in-hand. Pics do NOT do it justice. Overall, while it's way too expensive for what it is (60-70 USD) I'd say it's worth biting the bullet if you can find it. It's a blast to play around with AND display. https://t.co/yn3fXCT7aq
With a simple amount of parts swapping that's actually pretty easy to do, you can replicate it's four-armed mode! The extra arms are just as bendy as the main pair, though the 2 pairs can bump into each other during certain poses. https://t.co/mfQQnZa2ff
This guy R O C K S .  Insanely dynamic &amp; bendy, even if the ratcheting revoltech joints take a bit of work to figure out properly. Comes with only one (1) Funnel, but on the plus side, it's got an A.T. Field effect bit! https://t.co/LgnshMail6
So, because I promised @Claywh0re (and I just like to show this guy off) here's Revoltech Evangelion Unit 13!! https://t.co/e5AGSt4jgx
@Claywh0re Where's the lie tho https://t.co/ysMnECmYCL
