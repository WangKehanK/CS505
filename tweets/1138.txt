@KarlyKimerer So true!
@BenjaminVanDyne Agreed from a Weston who inexplicably become a Wes half of the time.
Was the eighteenth century really as chill as I‚Äôm led to believe it was? I just feel like everyone from about 1850 onwards really needed to take breather and a moment to collect themselves. The eighteenth century on the other hand, I feel like most people just had it together.
@carcassofalion Okay, not to demonstrate my ignorance or anything but what is that building? I see it all the time.
@0ddette NO!!! You can‚Äôt just, umm, provide affordable housing!!!

@cameronernst_ And I suppose memory could potentially serve me well considering the breadth of literature I plan on studying is somewhat limited.
@cameronernst_ Thank you. I‚Äôve heard it explained that it‚Äôs the first year or so of learning that is difficult. One you get your feet under you, it‚Äôs not so difficult.
@cameronernst_ Biblical or classical.
@BrysonMansker Bryson, get out of here, this is between my followers and I. https://t.co/99pxuW2S9g

@BrysonMansker Me going to tell my mom that some random snake just ate my ticket to unending lifeüò§
@DumbellTom Yes, that would be great.
@kprnews At what times from 6:00AM to 8:00AM do you do station breaks? Trying to adjust my clock-radio.
@wjplaschke This is wonderful. Blake too has been a forceful figure in my Christianization. I can‚Äôt quite remember but I think I came across him while reading Jerusalem. I just bought a Blake + Donne anthology the other day. Can‚Äôt wait to read more.
@DumbellTom So previously, say before 1960, would the norm have been a morning prayer with Eucharist once a month or so?
@BrysonMansker How did you get this photo of my nightstand?
@BrysonMansker Oh wow, I think you were going to substitute Tillich for Augustine and keep Cranmer- interesting.
@BrysonMansker Predictable
Ah, I suppose I have forgotten C.S. Lewis-
Which four theologians have influenced your faith life the most? Kierkegaard and Tillich in my personal faith and Cranmer and Calvin in my understanding of church and the faith more broadly. https://t.co/eHfEsPkgCl https://t.co/BdJjNMTujs
@BrysonMansker The internet is ruining this generations greatest minds.

@jodecicry @dvdpeters Similar to the American flag for some inexplicable reason, it too would constantly be flying at half mast.
The BCP‚Äôs methodical wording in the confession starting out by saying ‚Äúwe have left undone those things which we ought to have done‚Äù before saying ‚Äúwe have done those things which we ought not to have done‚Äù has slowly but totally reshaped how I conceptualize sin for the better.
