First on Wednesday night I was running up the stairs and fell &amp; bit through my tongue, and today I went to bend over &amp; didn’t realize there was a chair in front of me and my tooth went right through my front lip at work and had to get it glued. Is this how 2020 is going to go..?
@yourduhreams @itskenzbenz Omg!!!🥺😖😳

Home owner things...heat going out in the house 2 days before Christmas..😭 not the happiest person today 😕
Let me tell you hearing my brother talk about all the things he has planned to do with his son in the future really makes me very happy and thankful that he’s having a boy 💙👶🏻💙👶🏻
Today, it’s his 18th birthday, we find out at 5pm if we are going to have a niece or nephew. Standing on the top block today would complete the whole day 🤼‍♂️❤️🥳👶🏻 https://t.co/iFbEBXt0RM

@CraigTalynn Love you 💕 thanks for everything you do for me. I’d be lost without you and @palma_jasmin
I don’t think anyone understand how good life is treating me rn, this time last year I was a depressed, tired and hopeless and unhealthy. Now I’m happy healthy and so much more confident in myself. Can’t believe what a year can do to you!
