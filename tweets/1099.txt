So disappointed that Snapchat is not providing me help. It‚Äôs been over 24 hours and I am locked out of my account. I have the code to verify my device and I can not yet in. Not happy.  @snapchatsupport https://t.co/uqxLjys6KS
@snapchatsupport very disappointed in the lack of help and support Snapchat is providing me to log into my account. ridiculous
@h0llaJess @CW_Riverdale omg so crazy!!
luke from @GilmoreGirls and jack from virgin river would definitely be friends
@Big955Chicago But yet we can‚Äôt do this anymore
@Big955Chicago I was on 95.5 HD2 and I couldn‚Äôt even listen to the Bobby bones show this morning... this is so ridiculous not sure why this change happened
@rushfootball88 @MLB Right they need to stay in one area to avoid spreading it
it is so funny how some people just throw a friendship away and act like you were never in their life. so to all the friends I lost over the years, sometimes I wish I knew or understood why, but, oh well.
@rushfootball88 @MLB Good point but Arizona the cases are high. Just have the MLB play their games Toronto at the dome stadium
@McDonalds apparently McDonald‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have nuts ü•ú as an option anymore with their hot fudge sundaes .... when did this happen and why ? ):
really nice to realize where you stand with some friends
@SchooledABC I‚Äôm so sad Schooled was not renewed for another season. hopefully @netflix or @hulu can pick up this funny show
Last episodes ending will definitely make you cry!! #fullerhouse #Netflix #series
@fullerhouse thank you for making 5 seasons of this amazing series. I spent so many nights as a kid watching Full House. Fuller House brought me a great series and so many laughs. officially just watched the last episode and I‚Äôll definitely miss this show üíó
@instagram why is my followers and following count changing so drastically?!
so wrong!! https://t.co/PusBnltdo7
can‚Äôt wait to teach about the year 2020 as a history teacher one day
Check this out! Super easy $1,000 scholarship to apply for! https://t.co/QcmJxTwhu1
@snapchatsupport I didn‚Äôt get the little birthday gift as the messages from my friends it was just normal Snapchat all day
@lukecombs Friday is my 20th birthday, can you please give me a shoutout on your live?
@Snapchat Is the Easter egg hunt happening this year? Thanks!!
there should‚Äôve been proms, graduation, and fun times happening. so many people work so hard and the little things are what we look forward to the most. birthday celebrations are at a pause and life is just at a halt. routines are so different now.
it should‚Äôve been a March filled with St. Patrick‚Äôs Day celebrations. An April filled with Easter joy and blessings. The second semester of college was barely just beginning as it ended, in person, too soon. Life changed in the blink of an eye.
@angelinaaaaaxx same ang
It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm back in high school right now. In my room constantly. On my laptop doing ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù from my five classes. &amp; barely seeing @michaelpisto68
I should be on a flight to Atlanta right now actually enjoying my spring break üôÑ
when I‚Äôm a history teacher one day, I‚Äôll be teaching kids about coronavirus üò≥ #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus
No school &amp; the cheapest gas prices I‚Äôve seen in awhile. #coronavirus #COVID„Éº19
