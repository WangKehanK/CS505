Online classes really are a joke. Anyone out here actually learning? Or are we all just coastin and tryna stayin afloat?
@SendNoodzBitch @HoneyDipped___ And this right here is bullshit. I work 30 hours a week and go to school full time but my parents claimed me as a dependent so i dont get one. Even tho i support myself, and pay all my bills. Its hard to save money when you barely make enough to pay all the bills.
I know its technically spring break, but I have yet to recieve plans for the rest of the semester and I kinda need to know😠😒
Social media is so dead at these hours😴
