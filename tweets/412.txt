i’m having an early life crisis
@Okami_kam okay no bc my love for him is completely platonic
my english advisor is so cute i love him
@soigneli THE SEPTUM PIERCING LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU
i’m down bad as fuck his laugh is so cute :////
i feel like this is the most embarrassed i’ve ever been in my life
@XxQueenDesxX that show was ass. i still binged the whole first season tho
my boss makes me want to not alive myself
he’s so cute but his accent 🤢🤢
some of y’all are more attractive when you keep your mouth shut
the weather needs to act right. i’m ready for picnic dates
i just want to look cute in low waisted jeans :/
the most chaotic thing i do is use one notebook for 5 classes
@KINGK4M i said what i said argue with yourself
@KINGK4M putting them back after you traumatized them is not the correct answer. sorry but your time traveling privileges are revoked until further notice
@KINGK4M and also there’d most def be the need to get rid of their other version of themselves
@KINGK4M so you’d ruin two universes just to see what would happen?? you know what you need to stay away from the time machines. humans today can’t even comprehend our history so there’s no way they’d just accept a whole different one
@KINGK4M you’re not supposed to mix events of separate timelines and existing with other versions of ourselves is the biggest no no. plus different timelines, different decisions and different relationships. there’s too many uncontrolled variables
@KINGK4M i feel like that would destroy both timelines
spanish homework has been kicking my ass 😭😭
i have class with the weird kid today 😓
i show up to my 9:30 looking so busted idec
i love my friends they’re so nice to me 🥺🥺 id probably die for them
january is the longest momth of the year why
only day 3 of classes and im so drained already ://
the way i look on past events as simply memories that no longer affect me &gt;&gt;&gt;
and if your response is “bc of the mature content” you should stop sexualizing minors
i’ll never understand why Netflix consistently chooses to make shows about high schoolers but casts 25+ year olds to play them...
idk what i did in a past life but i really don’t think i deserve the negative energy that comes with my younger sibling...
@KINGK4M EXACTLY IT WAS BS
i’m so excited to eat breakfast
shifting?! yes please
@a__nette yuppp
i love that everyone in my 400 level english class is on the same page. we’re all starting our final papers that are due tonight today 🥰
there’s literally people in the gc saying don’t look at the exam key if you aren’t emotionally ready... my professor is such a dick
i hate class presentations my voice be shaking and i don’t even care fr 😭😭😭
@a__nette don’t even do that
@a__nette seeee don’tttt even be coming over here yelling at me like that
sometimes i think about the time my bestfriend made me get a tattoo so she wouldn’t be getting one alone
if my spirit guides want me to pass philosophy, i will. i’m leaving it in their hands ☺️
@BRAZYBR3 as a capricorn moon... ur right
