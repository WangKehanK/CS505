@bunniibunns LMAOOOO it’s fine but I love you 🥺💞 https://t.co/qlFrRwOXEm
@bunniibunns It’s fine I wanna kick this persons ass already LOL
Also shout out to the people in the past who have seen me talk about this here and genuinely changed. I’m sorry I’m aggressive abt it but only here, I really love and appreciate anyone taking the time to do me right pronoun wise
Anyone who doesn’t know me and calls me they/them pronouns is fine. Anyone who can’t remember and just uses they/them is fine!!!! I’m talking abt people who claim up and down abt how we’re friends or how long we’ve known each other 🥴
this isn’t a discussion it’s transphobia!!!! I have so many people I’ve had to cut off for not stopping doing this but genuinely if you call us friends and can’t gender me correctly then we’re not!
hey if you know I’m a trans man and you call me they/them pronouns youre misgendering me :)
