@DetroitRoomies aw :(
I don’t know what it’ll be, but I’m gonna come home with something Different today.  Might be a cat.  Might be a piercing.  Might be hair dye.  Might be new makeup.  Might just be groceries.  Who fucking knows. Not me. Lets GOOOOO
Doctor: You are what you eat.  Me: So the scoliosis is because of the sour gummy worms huh
It is *always* stressful to get sick when it means missing work, but so much of that is relieved when I know that I’m not going to lose my job because of it.
I can’t say enough how grateful I am to have a boss that is understanding of the unpredictable and often inconvenient consequences of chronic illness and living with a compromised immune system.
@detroitdumbass We applied today to adopt a 9 month old cat with extra toes so his feet look like little mittens 😭
We’re going cat shopping tomorrow :3
Max: I am your emotional support lemur.   And he’s right.
In this house, we put the bong on a coaster.
Feeling cute, might fuck around and enjoy some GODDAMN SEROTONIN later
It is Wednesday, my dudes. #2020
After working at HomeGoods when the trend turned into a cult, I immediately like a person less when I see them with Rae Dunn pottery as a main feature in their home.   You people are fucking insane. We had soccer moms physically fighting over lumpy bumpy ceramics fuck OFF with ye
I am in the best fucking mood.   I’ve got most of the stuff we’ve brought over unpacked and organized, I found my wax warmer and the house smells amazing, and I have a freshly laundered and made bed to get into tonight with my popcorn and tea.   It got better 🖤
We were literally just celebrating finally being ahead for once, whoops.
You know 🙂  Sometimes 🙂   It’s really hard to try and stay positive 🙂 and not let the bad things overshadow the good things 🙂 Especially the big good things like this new apartment 🙂 But good fucking god 🙂 shit 🙂 just 🙂 keeps 🙂 happening 🙂
*Tweets about Good things finally happening* *Discovers a new, very expensive Bad Thing that is going to probably need to  be addressed immediately*  🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
I want to give a life update but I feel like I have to explain why this particular move is so exciting, and that’s a long, long story to give with all of the background information, the twists, the turns, and the fuckery. Suffice to say though, something good finally happened🖤
It fucking sucks out here sometimes.  Just be nice to each other.
I really hope that the pets that belong/belonged to the ex partners and friends that I’ve had along the way are doing well.
This man is an author and his books are just as much fun to read as this tweet. https://t.co/duVUbXeuOV
Would it even be a holiday if I didn’t end up dealing with ridiculous medical bullshit tho
I just remembered that my best friend and I growing up used to pass notes to one another that were written in actual runes. It was frequent enough that after a while, I didn’t need the translation chart.  I knew a whole fucking different alphabet that I just up and forgot.
I really miss having an appetite.
I can’t wait until I get to sleep in a bedroom with insulation again.
@babblingruss How dare
@livlover13 That’s big talk from a dude whose chin and forehead have separate postal codes.
Even if nothing else good happened this year, by the time 2019 ends, we will have been blessed with both a new Rammstein album, and then a new Lindemann album 7 months later.   Good things still happen.
At the end of the day, it is absolutely important to make sure that the surface things are not the only think we think of when we discuss self-care, but it’s also important that we remember the value of caring for our mortal husk as well as the spirit that pilots it. #SelfCare
I exfoliated my face, so I don’t feel quite as self-conscious about simply existing in my own skin. And while my teeth do look superficially whiter, let’s not forget that the revolution of dental care is responsible for the addition of 20+ years to the average life span.
Self-care is not always the pampering things like hair treatments and face masks, but I feel like it’s important to remember that these things really aren’t only just superficial. My hair is in much better shape, so I feel more put together.
But today was good for self-care. I managed to touch up my hair and deep condition it, do a much-needed face mask as well as an in-depth cleaning on my teeth, I got a new razor and body wash, and I even remembered my facial moisturizer and to drink a giant glass of water.
Self-care has been difficult of late. I’ve had so many injuries now that I feel the oncoming storms in my bones at the ripe old age of 24, and the pain that I’ve been having this past week with the endometriosis alone has kept me damn near bedridden.
@babblingruss What, the WAY overpriced yet still cheap ass fucking makeup brushes and ineffective skin care line plus being a fucking Kardashian wasn’t enough of a money grab, are you KIDDING me?!
Me trying to decide whether I should sleep for 3 hours before work or wait it out and slam the caffeine instead. https://t.co/JnLq7Y3B1D
I lost my 120 day streak on Duolingo and I actually just want to fling myself into a black hole.
I hate my body, but it hated me first.
@JCornea @cameronhbg You definitely do not. You’re lovely. You’re doing great.
😂😂😂 I love it https://t.co/ERe6sFscB3
Getting to hear this after also getting to listen to Obama speak again recently has given me at least two (2) molecules of seratonin for the first time since 2016.   #LockHimUp https://t.co/SM5Vwnsc5x
I just saw a video with a girl wearing a bright v-neck tee and a black suit style vest with a lace back and I was immediately thrown way the fuck back to like 2008-2010 with my goddamn vest and flat iron 😭 No one told me about heat protectant spray 😭
I’m just gonna say it: George of the Jungle had no fuckin business giving us feelings like that at 8 years old
It’s totally fine to regularly have your first meal of the day after 10pm, right? That’s fine?
Y’all remember the scene in George of the Jungle with the horses and the billowy shirt? You’re welcome.
Is it ever not the right time to watch Ever After? I think the fuck not.
I made an awesome dinner tonight. Stir fried green beans, homemade Parmesan potato wedges, and ribeye steaks in garlic and herb butter with sautéed mushrooms and onions. There’s not a lot that I like much about myself, but I can fucking cook.

@JCornea Far left, behind the guy in the white button down shirt, the one who looks disgusted and 100% over everything happening around him.
@livlover13 I will make an exception for that one, because it seems to just be ranch with the odd bit of cheese, and I’m ok with that
Fuck blue cheese
Friend: How did you hurt your shoulder? Me, nervously: Not dancing too hard in the shower when @lizzo came on, that’s for sure 😅👀 #TruthHurts 😅😅😅
Nothing good ever comes from me going downstairs without my glasses on, even if it’s only for a moment.
Me: I haven’t offered anything, dear. You were snoring a moment ago. You can go ahead and continue that if you like.  Him: Okay. You’re a nice lady. *pets my hair*  Me: Thank you, sweetheart. Goodnight.  Him: *snoring again in seconds*
Max, out of a dead sleep: No thank you.  Me, scrolling through Facebook: No?  Him: No, I don’t want any—well on second thought, yeah I’ll have a few.  Me: A few? What do you need, my love?  H: What you just offered?
Keener 2020: Lol oh no https://t.co/T1oQB5gCuX
