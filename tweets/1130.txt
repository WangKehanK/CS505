‚ÄúLaw and order!‚Äù Right? Or only when it‚Äôs protesting brutal unnecessary deaths?
@derantemac01 Haha you‚Äôre not wrong
Hahaha https://t.co/zm3UzXqslz https://t.co/99UmQr5iKE
@AD__ONTHEWAY @Le0verrated @BleacherReport Mvp is based on regular season stats, but good try
@Mplace11 At least you lost to a team with a name, man
@Mplace11 A minor setback buddy. You‚Äôll be back before you know

I am sickened by the lack of leadership in this country. I didn‚Äôt think I could be any more disappointed. We literally don‚Äôt have a leader as a President. We‚Äôre a country run by an Ignorant hypocrite. To everyone affected by these murders, I am so sorry. We support you. #BLM
If you are not actively looking to be a part of the solution, you are a part of the problem. Systematic racism and prejudice must stop here. #BlackLivesMatter
But why...why open up America when the plans discussed mention nothing about ramping up testing in the midst of the virus‚Äô peak... https://t.co/22pjAphIPA

It‚Äôs times like these where you really have to come to terms with how boring of a person you actually are
RIP to one of the goats. Was my idol growing up https://t.co/O6G29e0DAT

Lynn Bowden. That is all. That‚Äôs the tweet.
He did it again üî• https://t.co/XyLgAReOpl
@IceyGilmore You‚Äôre also a pats fan, I understand now

@WTP_BDiehards Because ‚ÄúBrady doesn‚Äôt have any receivers this year‚Äù, remember? Can‚Äôt blame the whole year on that and expect one in the pro bowl buddy

Speechless, man
Daily reminder that absolutely nobody cares who you listened to on Spotify this year
That‚Äôs me listening to @tayhart5  before I tell him to get a breath mint https://t.co/HM1KX9KFKB
Love getting blown up on social media...it‚Äôs like the first time people have seen snow and the first time UK‚Äôs lost. Geez
Man it feels good when everything falls into place
@TREV0RM00DY Lmaooo
The homies tryna convince me to let them hit my juul https://t.co/lzHv4pmQRl
Fortnite has me literally shaking..
Man I love Stephen A https://t.co/n0sfMDE6z1
Have you finished those errands?
@AB84 What about getting canned by every team in the NFL and multiple rape accusations? Will that knock your focus off, bud?

@MichGator92 @TREV0RM00DY @NaturalWorks_ No worries man, I‚Äôll converse with you when I know we‚Äôve watched the same game, lmk. It‚Äôs okay to accept mediocrity
@MichGator92 @TREV0RM00DY @NaturalWorks_ What good plays..the 4 times that our back up corners left your receivers wide open? Or the 76 yard run at the end of the game when it didn‚Äôt matter
@MichGator92 @TREV0RM00DY @NaturalWorks_ That‚Äôs an awful, horrendous take. Florida scored off of 2 horrific turnovers in UK‚Äôs own territory. Florida‚Äôs notorious pass rush was completely stopped and Florida‚Äôs run game was non-existent. UK lost Bc of bad play calling/a missed field goal and mental errors. ReWatch the game

@joshhart @Eagles @Giants @dallascowboys Good call bro, stick to underachieving in the NBA #knowthevibe
@timthetatman @WageWar That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been sayin bruh
@SirDimetrious Got you bro, I have aim assist and am a god on pc with controller
@TreverMoody ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èdont give up:)
@TreverMoody Lmaooo if I see one more James family song I‚Äôll be sick
GGs only
@FortniteGame  are you all on hard drugs or crack? Not sure who‚Äôs behind decision making but this is the worst state of the game I‚Äôve ever played. It‚Äôs awful. If I wanted to battle robots I‚Äôd play rock em sock em. Quit the crack pipe. Geez
@TreverMoody @LBJamesHarden Lmaooooo
@TreverMoody Big facts, I despised him for 5,6 years without a real reason. Now I‚Äôve seen the light
@Stone_Poole_ Led a team to the best possible position to win a super bowl! A lot more than a lot of QB‚Äôs have done who are making just as much money (Stafford, Cousins, etc..)
These fans have gotta get their hands off players at games, man. One of these days their gonna get their ass beat. No shot they‚Äôd say a word or lay a hand on any player outside of a game
@tayhart5 Give these guys some help! I mean geez
@tayhart5 Draymond isnt their most important player by any stretch.The unanimous mvp and 3 timechamp would be their most important player. Quinn Cook is good but coming of of a backpacked ring he‚Äôs wearing and a g league filled career before last season. So yes it‚Äôs sad if the raptors lose
@tayhart5 Andre iguadola is hardly in his prime, and draymond has scored single digits on multiple occasions this postseason. Quinn cook is their 3rd best option
If the Raptors lose game 3 tonight, that is so sad. Warriors missing Klay, KD, Looney, all starters are playing with injuries. Would be sad to make the finals and get bounced by a couple g league players and Steph
@tayhart5 Everyone knows what that joke analyst is implying lol
@tayhart5 The ‚Äútrash player‚Äù mentioned in your retweet lmao
@tayhart5 On this day Boobie Gibson dropped 31 points on 78% shooting lmao
At the age of 21, in his first finals, San Diego State University unknown player Kawhi Leonard clamped 2 time champ Lebron James on his way to claim his first title and finals MVP at 21 years of ageü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/sPTN5hYwI8
5 straight finals! Top 5 shooter of all time! Grinds day in and day out to keep his team in the playoffs. Not even 3rd team all NBA. Pathetic. Deserves it over the overrated Westbrook and the choke artist Lillard- definitely over the playoff-starved Kemba Walker. Get outta here. https://t.co/ZjxvfYzo1J
@tayhart5 An Addison tradition!
@BleacherReport @NBAonTNT Probably why he continuously takes L‚Äôs in the playoffs! Get your head in the game or get bounced by a one man team again!
@tayhart5 Let‚Äôs not forget the perennial all star/world champ/ team USA Rep. Kevin Durant. Not to mention the top 3 of all time player you might‚Äôve heard of named Lebron? @DickieV
@jordanbassett9 I‚Äôm gonna act like I didn‚Äôt see this tweet
As a thunder fan, I‚Äôm in awe of Damian Lillard. Literally a goat
@LRoseBolar Tell us how you really feel
