@GhostlyOcam Careful if some of the Americans lurking around hear you they’re gonna start “countryside shaming” you or however social justice warriors term it.

@NicoloDTelesca @melessthanthree Little do the unsuspecting bidders know that this is actually a sting operation led by the reptilians who have finally seized their moment to rule the world.  ..they really don’t like that one chick for breaking up with Brad Pitt back in 200X
@Welflare Okay just as long as we don’t have to go full Disney and just cash in on reskinning existing property for the Gen Z audience.
@Hideki_Naganuma I have to check this out now, I didn’t know you did a remix on that album!
@Welflare I mean I think some people eat that kind of vague stuff up but in this scenario no that’s paramount reason to be getting the learning rod. https://t.co/TMZg11EvzF
@Welflare Holy shibbit I just remember that I cheated once using literal arrows between panels like this and you chewed me out for it https://t.co/C8LyRR2knk
@Welflare I guess it’s just easier to try to force it to read directly down
@Welflare Ah crap my brain is still reading l r l what the hell brain
Sharing again maybe don’t care this is what the world needs more of right now https://t.co/MZXaFHygQN
@Welflare Like obviously you can make it prettier this is a finger drawing
@Welflare The trick is to angle it. Like so. See the green becomes this mandatory creative negative space zone where you can shove in a title card or author credits, so I love using it for opening pages https://t.co/ZZKmp4U0pn
@Welflare There is a reason my panels are almost never 4gons it’s always like crazy angles and dynamic shit
@TheSMonroeShow You are a goddamn living legend. Don’t ever change. https://t.co/mCPsKEt0Ub
@cordiallycontgo @MochiMacchaArt https://t.co/8f11ZzMC00
@MochiMacchaArt 1) Alarms. Plural 2) Coffee. Three cups. 3) No caffeine after 6 pm 4) Fall asleep by midnight, but ideally 11pm. 5) Wake up with those alarms at the same time every day, including weekends, for about 2 to 3 weeks. 6) Do. not. Go. Back. To. Bed. Until bedtime.  HTH buddy https://t.co/AEc1ZjVjsg
@thea8p @bossy_bootz I mean people generalize and stereotype by biological design. Social structure builds on top of that, including intercultural relations. As far as the whole “dumb azz white boiz” going around venting their existential rage on the country- I can only speak for myself. And I’m https://t.co/gN3tuAgfyp
@thea8p @bossy_bootz Yeah. Oddly enough, these kinds of actions are a slap in the face to everything my family taught me, and I’m the poster child of white male privelege.   Or at least that’s what I say and then people be like “but do you do the things that people associate with that?” And I be like https://t.co/7aDETSraSR
@TheGentGuy give it a shot, the weather syncs is great and it genuinely feels like what we wanted to accomplish as youths. https://t.co/aUIEkFMq8o
@Welflare @akkitwts Hey that’s my specialty as a filthy moderate!! We can start a club! We’ll call it....”Void Sages 2020” because all we do is watch shit happen and react! https://t.co/SvYIff8Xs9

@thea8p But i THINK about it more that time of the month. My disorder seems to just be PMS with visions and intuitions. https://t.co/Ihq9FMwmlv
@thea8p Shit nah I've just wanted to be a dad since i was 6. No luck with women so far so I'm just like. Ignoring it or "dealing with it". I figure it'll happen someday, just hopefully before I'm too old to keep up with kids. I'd be fine working or being a stay at home dad tbh
@thea8p Aye. I'm just never a fan of the baby clock that comes with it. Yes, apparently that's a thing with ole sensei https://t.co/mWFKLxyURb

@thea8p Meanwhile in the middle of nowhere, Michigan, I’ve discovered the WONDERFUL WORLD OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISM.  I sure do love iterative design but I sure do hate rewriting the same darn article 5 times. Anw hope things are goin well for ya https://t.co/m0EMvgK4kD
@Welflare I don’t know how to feel about the fact that thundercats level anthro is perfectly fine to me but the moment you start moving any more bestial my inner &gt;sage wants to start greentext preaching to the world

I picked some images to paint in greyscale for practice https://t.co/inlkUCgrzF
@Welflare Not gonna lie, it’s very rusty. So rusty in fact, that the name of the “grain filter” is literally rust. I love how it’s working out so I’m running with it, this is all one brush
