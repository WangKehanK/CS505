My biggest struggle in life is I'm wearing my ugliest clothes possible and still look really hot
Faith: I am a piddlin' rights activist
I am one minor inconvenience away from listening to the front bottoms unironically
@butchalert I will drive to durham to do it
Hot take but I would make a really good psychiatrist.
Next year my birthday is on a Saturday. The party theme is Degrassi "Baby There's A Shark In the Water" commercial 10th anniversary.
Hot girl checked me out in the gender neutral bathrooms at the brewery so I can die happy
Anybody got a bigass head and want the first hat I've ever knit? She is yuge https://t.co/p4TykAzlcV

Wish that cult documentaries would be more sensitive toward my medical condition (being on testosterone) and not show naked boobies and ass ðŸ˜”

@tweet_deleter @butchalert Please cas... me too
I have been in emotional turmoil since I saw a baby yoda funko pop and can no longer enjoy baby yoda's soothing online presence.
@tweet_deleter That is incredible and I love that for you.
@tweet_deleter Horny on mane
@yourmorals This has the same energy as the tweet I saw saying "being a woman in academia is all about wearing classes and dangly earrings"
@kataynan I've got one for u!!
I've been looking for this video for 3 weeks now https://t.co/DmWFFvgcld
All trans focused fb groups are like "transgender this transgender that" like grow up I did and now I'm cis!
Last year my award was "Best Dang Plow Stops of The League" and this year it was the "CarJack'd Award"
My teammates raised money to help pay for my car repairs from when someone stole my engine last week and gave it to me at awards night tn Im ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
I know someone posted abt this but the lights are out on the Northgate mall to say NO T GA E
Surprised again to wake up and discover that alcohol is a neurotoxin

Tired: calling your friend to ask a question  Wired: texting your friend and waiting for a response  Inspired: messaging your friend on Grindr bc you know they'll check that notification before their texts

Please do not ask why my family has a brick pile.
Told my sibling about this post and they reminded me that one year at christmas we took a brick from our brick pile and gave it to our father
I dont want a queer bar. I dont want a trolley pub. I don't want a coffeeshop that sells beer. I just want a place where I can get drunk then eat a lot of ice cream.
My fav therapy sessions are when I go in and say "I'm doing rlly well" and then have to tell my therapist that I'm taking all my meds for once
@thestateonmtv @y2kate_ @tweet_deleter But yeah trying to keep disordered eating at bay while on stimulants is a very special hellscape
@thestateonmtv @y2kate_ @tweet_deleter ADHD and OCD are also super comorbid and have very similar abnormalities in dopamine pathways. Not all EDs are caused by OCD but since they can be a byproduct of OCD it makes sense that adhd and EDs would be linked.
Tweeted this dr*ving home from therapy and am absolutely gutted to say it turns out that is not an ASMR acronym
Yeah I listen to ASMR vids  All Songs Rock Myass
@them you got enough backlash to take down one of the tweets sharing the article but not the article itself?
It is 2019... Literally Almost 2020... and a queer blog decided to publish an article calling Boys Don't Cry a "chick flick" and a lesbian romance movie... and the cis author really thinks it's ok bc she isnt a TERF....
Me my first day back on skates after 4 months off of them: https://t.co/zaFd2KQ8i9
