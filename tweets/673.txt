I mean it is pretty clear America is leaning towards Communism. Just open your eye gates and see. All of this is prophecy, it has to happen before Jesus Christ comes back to End this world to establish the Kingdom of God here for ETERNITY!!
@mmckoy Oh if you tell them that they will start punching the air lol
@mmckoy 😂😂😂😂... I love telling them that’s why KD the best scorer of this generation 😭 https://t.co/VaCJTc7VbO
Building a Fresh Market in a Food Desert https://t.co/KtIHrC8uGr  She’s in New Orleans ❤️
Brooklyn about to force Lebron to go get 9 All Stars and 3, 6 man of the year   Players  😭
KD is the best scorer of his generation and it’s NOT a debate 😂
Gonzaga getting BEAT TO SLEEP 😂
@ClassicMan218 😂😂😂

@ClassicMan218 😂😂😂😂. I would of been boohoo crying
@ClassicMan218 Facts
Man that game was so good, but I know that hurts losing at the buzzer like that 😫
Spirit has been telling me to start paying attention to the Watchmen even more so!! Open your ears &amp; eyes 👂 👀
Man that could of been anyone’s game at the end. 🔥 #ncaaW
Bruh this S Carolina vs Stanford game has me like: https://t.co/yZfG5Pru3V
@YadhhaaE 😭😭😭😂. Staring at it like there’s an Undo button, like in Microsoft Word. https://t.co/z2568lXnep
@myTWEETer_ I’m Crine 😂😂😂 https://t.co/f1IBN6gSmI
@Bwizz5 Lol for real Wizz
@Bwizz5 Exactly lol. Bron is 36 on his way out the door. He’s still balling very well at his age, I’ll give him that, but Is 4 rings not enough lol
@Bwizz5 And people saying he isn’t impacting the game like Lebron. These Lebron fans just 😂. Power forwards and Centers literally can’t stick him. They’re building a Wall like Trump tried to do. 🥴 https://t.co/bgHmzYWFNK
To me, the NCAA women’s games have been more exciting.
I can’t believe the refs didn’t call that foul. Wow lol
This NCAA women’s game, Baylor vs UConn 🔥
People been saying this since last year. Well!! https://t.co/rwBBqwrfkb
@truth_kjb You do lol https://t.co/JvpAP3KWq4
@truth_kjb Bruh you’ve been having me crying for the last two days 🤣🤣😂😂 But yes these people are Bat crazy. It seems so surreal, but it’s really happening.
The ultimate goal these Governments want to do is to make every human into transhumanism beings. Chips in your hands, chips in your brain. They want to be gods so bad.
@ClassicMan218 LOL https://t.co/seDdFHDkVb
Lebron looking at the head coach in his second season if they lose the title this year. He’s about to reroute the team from scratch again LOL https://t.co/Ch6vi63MMM
@Bwizz5 LOL... I mean if he doesn’t win again this year I believe he isn’t winning anymore and the looks of it right now. He isn’t winning but I’m sure they will pull some strings like they always do. I’m curious who they will pick up.
@Bwizz5 Lol.. and then Aaron Gordon going to Denver. They will be even better too. You think they will get a buyout, like John Wall if they can?  They would have to get better players to come off the bench. At least who can play defense.
@Bwizz5 I’m not talking about Brooklyn, I’m talking about the Lakers 😂
@Bwizz5 They have to get some more pieces because their bench is boo boo lol
@truth_kjb 😂😂😂. For real. If people are worshipping it now, they will even more so when it shows up. He’s coming with the two fingers in the air/baphomet sign.
People think this devil worshipping is a game. Wait until they start revealing themselves to people. Then people will understand it’s not a game. People in Hell don’t think it’s a game. They wish they had another chance and being tormented day in and day out. 24/7, NO BREAKS!!
I had a dream last night Bitcoin hit $100k. Now when, idk Lol..
Lil Nas X isn’t the only one worshipping Satan and these demons. He just doesn’t care letting it be known he’s getting pimped out by the devil. There’s Nothing New Under the Sun.
@truth_kjb Silly gooses lol https://t.co/Tb6hVN4WcC
@Bwizz5 Facts
@ClassicMan218 😂😂... it’s not hard to make. It’s just water, vanilla extract, almonds (of course), dates/sweetener you like, a blender and nut bag. There’s 5 minutes YouTube videos on how to make it. Your welcome!! I learn so much from YouTube, I’m a whole mechanic because of it 😂
Made some Almond milk from scratch and mannnnn. Soo good.
@Bwizz5 For real though 😂 It is and people kept calling him fat. Zion is 280lbs of muscle lol.. if he was fat, he wouldn’t be moving and jumping like he is. And he will only get better. And another thing is he can take every big man off the dribble and they can’t stick him 1 on 1.
@Bwizz5 And he will eventually get one because they have a good shooting coach. They keep asking how to stick him? You can’t stick him, he’s too fast, can pass, handle the ball and he’s strong like a linebacker.
@Bwizz5 Right lol.. it’s mind blowing to me because he’s really that good in the paint.
Zion is 6’6 messing over every center and power forward he plays against. Dude legit scores ALL his points in the paint lol

@mmckoy Sad truth man. You’re setting your child up to get burned. I’m glad I wasn’t born into that 🥴
@mmckoy He sold out his kid, just like Will Smith did with Jaden.

Marriage is sacred for the Lord. So many verses on marriage but:   Hebrews 13:4 KJV  Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Mark 10:8 8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh https://t.co/y8x47WHiPG
Steph Curry is the Goat 🐐 when it comes to best 3 point shooting. He’s impeccable.

These will be the same ones asking for forgiveness when this world goes down the drain.
My family persecutes and is disrespectful as hell to me more than strangers, but it’s all good because I count it all blessings. People HATE to see a person that’s changed or changing because it shows them who they truly are. I don’t force anyone to change/have a repented heart.

If you can’t see senseless acts of killing almost daily around the world, selfishness, and the amount of devastations. Rumors of wars and wars. The Government trying to take away every right you possess isn’t enough for you to see we are in the Last Days. Idk what will. I don’t.
A police Officer in New Orleans just lost his life over a senseless act of a person pulling a gun and shooting him at a high school basketball game. I’m so sorry for him and his family. Just hurts my heart.
One of my fav players. If he didn’t get hurt like he did. Easiest top 5 point guard to play the game. He was just DIFFERENT! https://t.co/x6HmGAPB5S
My little sister team played hard, even though the refs were cheating 10 year old children. I hate when they call unfairly against kids. But they still won and will tomorrow too. 🔥
These churches are so watered down because a bunch of Freemasons run them and the people going to them can’t see that.
If YAH opened your spiritual eyes and your scared to speak truth and scared to get persecuted, or sit in a corner and let everyone else do it. My baby, you will have to give an account on why your being so scared to your Father. I rather be hated than thrown in 🔥 for fearfulness
The Followers of Christ really be having me Joked. Y’all don’t understand how goofy I am. I really cry laugh sometimes 🤣
When The Most High said he was going to break me out of anger I’ve had for yearrrrrrssss. He was not lying because these last two months has been a trial. I’m getting better at it everyday. Some days are better than others, but I’m working on it. 😊
@Bwatts18 He def traveled on that shot lol but a great game.
When the Holy Spirit is speaking through, you it’s like a time lapse. You think you were talking to a person for 20-30 mins, but it really was an hour or two. That’s how the Spirit comes through you.
John 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Romans 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God
A True Believer hears the voice of God.   John 10:27 “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:”  John 8:47 “He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.”
@Whoa_9 Naw it’s not. Go research on what the 6 is. Majority of your favorite artists, entertainers, celebrities all do the same signs making 6s/Freemason signs. He’s a warlock..lol..
Who is Drake rapping to on his songs when he’s always saying the “6” “me and the 6” “6 god” “love for the 6 because it made me” so on and so on?
@mmckoy She’s a whole witch. Kanye seems like he’s trying to bust out of that MK Ultra, but I could be wrong.
You know how to spot a spirit of Satan. They’re always accusing you of something, accusing your actions. Accusations of you doing wrong 😂. Make them more mad by showing/displaying the wisdom of The Most High. They tear other people down just to get people on their side.
