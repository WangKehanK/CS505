Our 4 year anniversary is in two days.... where has time done
Thaasss my babyyy🥰 @Jazminelorraine https://t.co/IJKX7myW9H
Tryin to keep my mouth shut to avoid drama but damn it’s hard... yall be out here lookin like damn fools.. that’s why I stay in my bubble✋🏼
Everyone’s out riding and I’m home alone :(
If you guys could get the word out it would mean a lot to me and my second family! https://t.co/sINfSeuaOE
Never take life for granted❤️ live it and don’t regret a thing you never know what tomorrow brings
Chris’s friends know I’m sad about him not being home and they asked me to go to dinner with them😩 they’re so nice to me.. I didn’t go cause I’m exhausted but still that’s just so thoughtful
@Jazminelorraine *4 am🤣 https://t.co/gAodx3BmzR
@Jazminelorraine
I had a freakin blast last night with my babies but I am so hungover I still feel tipsy🙃 https://t.co/NSw430Hz19
I hate being a woman sometimes.. I’m in so much pain right now 😢 feels like someone is inside my body wringing out my insides like a wet rag
Two more days till I get to see my man and it can’t come soon enough
These next two weeks better go by fast😭😭 I miss my hubby
I’m feeling so lazy today I don’t think I’m getting anything done around here today
I just want it to be warm again😩 I’m ready to get out and ride again
Last night was fun but mannn recovery is rough today🥴
My birthday was yesterday but I plan on celebrating alllll weekend looking forward to my man to get home today so we can go eat, and I can get drunk 🤪 https://t.co/n7RqrtszTi
Love my work family! https://t.co/lYHEFMPlI4
I got breakfast in bed today❤️ my honey is a keeper... I love him more than he will ever understand
The best thing about one of my friends being a door dash driver is when she delivers to our old boss who fired us both and we now know where he lives😏🤣
Happy happy birthday @delaneeywarner! I’m so happy that we crossed paths and that we picked up where we left off🥰 hope you have a great birthday wish you were here to celebrate 💗💗💗 https://t.co/7GmN7h8VWb
Sometimes I don’t think @sydneybrill17 is prepared for what I say to her🤣
@j__leander They were TERRIBLE!!!
@Jazminelorraine Girl if you don’t message me right now with the deets I’m beating your ass🤣 love you😘
Has anyone ever been to Ocean Isle? If so can you recommend places to eat or visit there?? 🤩
Possibly going to the beach twice this summer and that is something to be happy about 🤩
This is the one thing I hated about being friends with my old friend she talked to her kids like they were grown men... it hurt me every time. Kids are so sensitive and impressionable treat them right https://t.co/VAMO1EowaQ
I feel so much better after sleeping all night, I swear being tired makes me so emotional
@HaasLyndsey I miss you😭
@kadalinawinemxr Yeah I just get in my feels sometimes
@HaasLyndsey I needed this💗
I can’t keep doing this to myself I swear I’m my own worst enemy
I just want someone to talk to when I feel this way... 😭
@EltonCastee I hope you loved WV😇 I can’t wait for this video!
I’m laying here and it hits me that my Pappaw’s birthday is this week and he would’ve been 66, this time of the year is always hard cause I miss him so much, he’s missing so many things and I just wish he was here😭😭
I can’t sleep even tho I’m so tired and now chris is snoring and making it so much harder to fall asleep
I find it absolutely CREEPY when someone adds me on Snapchat BY SEARCH and I have no idea who they are and they aren’t from around here🧐
@foreman_kale My cousin sells cookies if you’re wanting some I can get them for you :)
@kent_haleigh I was off for 7 weeks back in April and I called everyday and yelled at someone!! My last resort was calling the governors office and I got back pay finally! The gov office even called me and said I got my money I was livid tho no one should have to go through that!
I’ve been alone in this house Friday and Saturday and chris is off all day today and what does he do? Sleep all day... so I’ve been alone and bored 3 days in a row
@kayleeedawnn Awesome it’s a boy!!
I might hit my husband in the head right now I swearrrrr I’ve been in this house too long and I can’t take it anymore!!
Can’t never have nothin nice
If I start making these to sell would anyone be interested in buying? https://t.co/OGzyKxFzql
@_robbz Girl Walmart and kohl’s have sales sometimes on stuff like that and they aren’t too bad on the prices! I love mine!!
If I have to sit in this house any longer I’m gonna go bat shit crazy
I just wanna be able to go out to eat, go to concerts and spend time with all the people I love... ready for this pandemic to end
Okay I’m just ready for summer now, the beach is all I have to look forward to now lol
@HaasLyndsey @CastoEmily I just need money idc how much lmao
@CastoEmily @HaasLyndsey Don’t be playing with me I’m bout to be pissed🤣😅
@HaasLyndsey How tho????
Where does time even go!!!! I feel like it’s been a year maybe 2, and that’s how you know you picked the right one
Chris and I will be together almost 4 years this coming year... my mind is blown!
@morgandsnyder Especially now with covid I don’t do anything other than work
@HueyMack I live so far out that a 10 pc nugget meal from Wendy’s would cost me $30 to door dash it... I hate it here lol
@morgandsnyder Really that’s all I feel like I do anymore lol
Ran into my ex today and it was the most awkward experience I’ve ever had in my whole life...
I’ll be glad to leave some things behind in 2020... I hope 2021 is better🙃
Chris hasn’t bought anything for Christmas yet and he was gonna go tomorrow on his day off and now he has to work.... both of us being procrastinators is just not a good mix🤣
@HeyyJesse_ 😭😭 youre so sweet thank you beautiful
@Jazminelorraine Thank you babe, I love you😭😭😭
I hate winter, I hate covid and I hate seasonal depression
You ever just feel... ugly and so uncomfortable in your own skin that you just wanna isolate yourself from everyone cause same.
In my feels tonight, fighting back tears rn over something stupid, what’s wrong with me? 🥺🥺
Girls get the worst end of the deal I swear😭 I’m in SO much pain right now but I have to slap on a smile and go to work because “it’s just my period” and I feel like that isn’t a good enough excuse to call off
@j__leander Both versions are so good but this one hits different 🥺😻
@samanthadornick Ugh! Well never mind then😭🤣
@samanthadornick I saw a trick on TikTok that’s supposed to work... you burn an orange and then peel it and mash up the inside and put two tablespoons of brown sugar on and eat it, they say it only works if you eat it when it’s hot... idk if it works but worth a try!
@kadalinawinemxr Shut up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@sydneybrill17 Thanks! Hard work pays off!!!
Y’all I got a raise today and I’ve never been more happy, also had my evaluation and my boss said I’m doing amazing and I’ve never felt more appreciated at a job🥰🥰
I think it’s really disrespectful to tell someone you’re not even gonna try to say their name and try to give them a nickname... like sorry my name isn’t that difficult you’re just lazy
I think chris wants to put a baby in me... I’m just not mentally prepared for that
Packed his lunch for work so I better get extra attention when I get home tomorrow 🙃
Me rn... miserable for unknown reasons😩 https://t.co/cP8yE1QWDb
Chris just rolled over and snuggled up to me and all I said was ew you’re sweaty and so he rolled back over all sad😅
@Jazminelorraine Can we go back to the Christmas tree night 🤣
I miss my boo thang... @Jazminelorraine can rona be gone so we can go out😩
Having to watch Jake Paul fight before this Mike Tyson fight is just the cherry on 2020... 🤢🤢
Chris said when he got home he was gonna come give me a kiss, he did not so now I am going to pretend sleep so I can ignore him🥰
I’m so happy for them!! https://t.co/FOUhv03ZCd
Gotta get through tomorrow then I have 4 days off🤪
I can never unsee what I just saw🤢🤢
