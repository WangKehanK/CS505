Guess who’s not going to physical therapy because I went once and talking to people for an hour is not fun and my anxiety is too high for me to go so now I’m beating myself up because I’m a useless piece of trash #justbpdthings #bpd #whyamilikethis
Hi I got a new job at a local museum and gardens and it’s so nice being in such a pretty place all the time 💖 https://t.co/SwQ6RVzkqP
My Texan bf is currently telling his grandma about the number of rabbits here in Indiana and it’s literally the cutest thing. “I literally see four or five on the way to Walmart. I’m going to look out the window rn I bet I’ll see one.” He’s amazed.
My bf grew up in Texas and his only experience with snow was during college in Oklahoma. He is experiencing his first Indiana winter and he hates the cold but he LOVES the snow. He’s like a little kid playing in the snow when we go on walks it’s the best thing 💗
🐈 he loves my boyfriend more it’s very apparent  https://t.co/W9zybjbjrU
A late Christmas present for my boyfriend #DemonSlayer is such a great manga and anime 😩 this is a page directly out of the end of the manga #nezuko #tanjirou https://t.co/eMpbAGiWIP
@TANOBlWAN Also, mental health is SO important. If you are stressing so much, then rest. It’s okay to fail, especially when it means looking out for your mental and physical well-being! It will get easier!
@TANOBlWAN Failing a final, even a class does not mean you’re going to fail your major! College sucks and it’s so hard to manage time and stress. I’ve failed classes, and re-taken them. I know it’s hard and can be so discouraging, but don’t give up. Just rest now and try again.
So my manager complains about every one of her employees and I learned today she’s been complaining about how I...do my homework...while there’s no customers...like??? How is this bothering anyone?? Bitch YOU write my case briefs then fuck off

I was so scared I would have to wait hours in line to vote so I went a few hours before I needed to nap for work and it literally took 5 minutes.
