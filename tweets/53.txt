@realNathanSchul Tough to watch? Made me laugh
@NYGovCuomo But....so what
United Parcel Service: UPS AND FED EX MUST CHANGE THEIR DECISIONS TO STOP VAPE MAIL! - Sign the Petition! https://t.co/VcWsh1Qqtj via @Change
@MigVapor Did that years ago
@alli_vapes Politicians want you to smoke cigarettes, they must know best.
@Innokintech Just ordered one, thanks for great products!
@Innokintech Left
@Innokintech Honestly, A. That's why I only use zcoils and innokin products!
@Innokintech D. Being able to purchase online and get it delivered.
@dashvapes Works fine on android....thanks for the video!
@SenatorRezin Same can be said about federal government sticking a ban on usps delivery of vape into the 5,000 page covid relief bill. Most politicians have their own agenda (greed). 10% public approval of government, I wonder why
@DIYorD1E I have been mixing for 2 months now, love it, And a big FU to politicians these days!!
@Innokintech 0.8 is my favorite, 16 watts is perfect
@LungAssociation I've been off cigarettes for over 2 years now because of vaping. Started at 18 mg nicotine, now at 6mg nicotine. You should embrace vaping....idiots!
@DickDurbin I'm looking forward to the day when politicians see vaping as harm reduction
@Innokintech Awesome, thanks for the chance at your giveaway! Love innokin!!
@realDonaldTrump USPS delivery of vape ASAP!
@JBPritzker @realDonaldTrump That bill is over 5,000 pages, with every politician shoving their wants into it. Separate everything non covid related.
@Innokintech C
@realDonaldTrump Merry Xmas Trump, drain the swamp and allow vape mail through USPS!!
@Innokintech B
@Innokintech @pbusardo @VapinGreek Zlide not slide. Damn autocorrect!
@Innokintech @pbusardo @VapinGreek I absolutely love this. Very lightweight. Much warmer vape then my slide tanks. All I use is innokin. Ordered another one. https://t.co/Emje1Qc2Lb
@Innokintech Love innokin https://t.co/BcSqilY20B
@realDonaldTrump USPS still delivers vape supplies without signature! Hopefully they still do third quarter and beyond!
@reaIDonalTrump_ Yes you should. And I should be able to get vape supplies delivered through the USPS without my signature.
@Innokintech Been vaping over 1 year, quit cigs after 20+ years. I have only used zenith and zlide tanks. Would I notice better flavor with the ares 2? Coils easy to build?
@Innokintech Looking forward to trying the Ares 2
@realDonaldTrump Do it now! Dont even hesitate
@realNathanSchul More this I bet https://t.co/XjuAAbXMgs
@Innokintech Proton mini!!
@Innokintech MVP5 and Zenith Pro makes a great all day MTL combo. https://t.co/f6busP4AO7
@MassGovernor Bring on the bathtub eliquid!!! We all need a little hair in our tanks!
@staaacy1981 @boston25 Bloomberg will....its about the kids
@PaulBates7 Bloomberg is a fucktard
@staaacy1981 @boston25 They wont ban counterfeit flour, they will ban legal flour!
@jerryreedjr Mind if I copy/paste that and email to my governor and reps?
@SuckMyMod I smoked 1 to 2 packs a day for 20 plus years. Quit 7 months ago. I strictly MTL and use a 6mg.
@ParentsvsVape @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @SecAzar @MittRomney is on your side! That has to make you feel proud!  https://t.co/NbbTRrfSY9
@DickDurbin You are standing on the side of @MittRomney and Big Tobacco! You and Romney want flavors gone, more cigarettes sold = more government money!  https://t.co/NbbTRrfSY9
@SenPatrickjoyce I quit combustible cigarettes with vaping flavored nicotine. I was a pack - 2 pack a day smoker for 20plus years. That 16 million can be cut way down with flavored nicotine eliquid. Its harm reduction and it WORKS!
@KellyannePolls @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Flavors got me off of combustible cigarettes. I was a pack to 2 pack a day smoker. Could not of done that without flavors. I feel 100% better.   This should not be taken away from adults.
@bodhicat54 He has an agenda and he can piss off! Corrupt mofo!
@American_Heart Flavors helped me as an adult get rid of combustible cigarettes. Down to 6mg nicotine now.   You guys are "Big Corruption" #quitlying
@LungAssociation Not even a compromise for adults use. Just an all out ban of flavors. @MikeBloomberg donations to you. Corruption! You will never receive donations from me or my family.
@XoBabbz Very well said!
@SenatorDurbin Do you even read your own links?  Flavored nicotine is NOT the problem!  Sheesh you pinhead!
@SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump should act on protecting americans health, by....  T21 Strong penalties for underage sales Strong online age verification Adult only stores can sell More education for the underage  Theres so much that "Big Con" (Congress) could be doing besides all out ban.
@Innokintech Podin has great looks. Great job Innokin!
@gopaulblair Dems would ban time travel!
@john14_15 @DickDurbin And how come you dont see government removing cigarettes? They kill people every day! Its illegally filled THC carts with vitamin E acetate that has done the damage, but yet this created the teen "epidemic" issue. Why am I feeling like the bad guy in this?
@john14_15 @DickDurbin Teens use nicotine flavors so this warrants an all out ban of flavors? Even for adults? You dont think it's over reach of government? Create stricter penalties for selling to minors. Only allow flavors at adult only stores. Stricter online age verifications.
@john14_15 @DickDurbin https://t.co/6bhUV2H1RB
@MikeBloomberg Punishing adults by banning flavors because of what teens do is not the answer. There are many ways to stop teen use. What's really your agenda?
@john14_15 @DickDurbin https://t.co/NTiLESsjZv
@UnbreakableHate I smoked 20plus years, not one time did any branch of government think about taking cigarettes away. The corrupt and greed is bullshit. It's all about the millionaires agenda. So adults pay for shit teens have done. I will stand beside any vaper!
@UnbreakableHate 7 month vaper here, I am so thankful I found vaping. I am curious, is this the worse its been?
@RepThomasMassie You as adults should only have 1 decaffeinated coffee.  You arent allowed flavors You arent allowed caffeine (protect those kids)
@SenatorDurbin Lung damage? I smoked for 20 plus years...since I started vaping flavored nicotine my lungs havent felt this good for a long long time....you are a fool #QuitLying
@net_vape @SenatorDurbin You know what's really sad...Dick Durbin lost his dad to Big Tobacco but yet he is so against vaping, it HAS to be the money he gets! Pfft....idiot
@net_vape @SenatorDurbin Durbin needs to go, pension paid for by Big Tobacco
@mikesubin @American_Heart Very true indeed!
@schmidci @American_Heart Fuck this government https://t.co/gtVV4vndif
@UnbreakableHate @schmidci @American_Heart I have so much stockpiled as well. And coils for my zlide and zenith tanks. I strictly MTL vape
@UnbreakableHate @schmidci @American_Heart Yep yep yep
@DickDurbin https://t.co/e2fMNR42zh
@JCLongaire Agreed!
@michelleminton @GrimmGreen Found this from this morning  https://t.co/Uob9irlSs7
@michelleminton Thanks for the info. The Gov is for it. Grrrrrrrrrr
@michelleminton @GrimmGreen howd ya hear about Illinois? i am curious
@DickDurbin You know what I am deeply disappointed by.......  The people of my government hurting it's own citizens by wanting to ban nicotine flavors. Wake up Dick, it gets people off of cigarettes! Your anti vape crusade benefits BIG TOBACCO!
