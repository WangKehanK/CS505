I think this is the first #WrestleMania I’ll be missing.   Sloppy, last second, put together card... I understand what we’re all still going through but the card isn’t grabbing my attention..  and Vince needs to let others take over already.
@SlapHut Are we talking about Meijer as a meme or the game 🤔

I keep using @GrimmGreen’s Lango he uses on his reviews/channel and my wife and chat on my Twitch Channel keeps asking me where I get it from 😂

It’s so shitty that our government would rather ban vaping while other countries endorse it...   It’s almost like it has to deal with money…
I’m just over it already.

My friends in these areas, please be safe, and keep your eyes/ears out, hopefully the Irish luck is on your side. https://t.co/n2C3uPSEmk
It’s 2021 and people still have the mindset that vaping is bad...

*cough @WOWCare fix your shit cough* https://t.co/EfS7pCeT3v
@KyleZiulkowski @WOWCare Their customer service kept wanting to assume it was my modem, my computer or an “outside” cable
@WOWCare i can copy and paste too you know..
@miwaterwitch im broke 😭
@WOWCare a whole week is very inexcusable, I feel like everyone who has been having problems should receive a discount on the next bill..  especially with these times of the pandemic and people working from home
@sdmf5150 @WOWCare lucky you  for me, its either deal with this BS or get ATT 25 mbps speeds...
@sdmf5150 @WOWCare OH REALLY?  Are they having you run net loss test and makin sure its YOUR equipment is wrong?  i spent 2 and half hours on friday trying to fix my internet.  cant pay the bills if i dont have the internet to work with..
@DrewSchultz88 @WOWCare @WOW_WAY y i k e s, remember when they say the customer is always right? yeah i guess not in WOWWAY's books..   maybe stop lying about how you have servers in troy when really youre using others servers like 123 net in Southfield.  unreal, 4 years ive been with wowway and im done this..
@WOWCare having really bad latency spikes... my wife and I work from home and this causes problems with our jobs, we cant go into another place to work with the ongoing pandemic.
@WOWCare Seriously... a week straight of nothing but problems, this is ridiculous
@miwaterwitch same tho
As a die hard ADTR fan, always sticking up for them over the years, the new album I can only get with two of the songs, the rest of the album... I just can’t 😥
Thanks for hanging out, catch ya next stream!  https://t.co/0tOcSiTr8R
I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.
Thanks for hanging out, catch ya next stream!  https://t.co/0tOcSiTr8R
hey @WOWCare can you fix your servers? and keep them up without issues for more than 24 hours? dear lord..

If people time and time again try and help you out, but you don’t help them in return and/or just be shady greedy selfish person  what makes you think they even wanna be associated with you?
