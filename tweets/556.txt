@Negative_Fox God you're smart haha I love that
For years when you entered Wisconsin from the Illinois border, all you saw was fireworks stores.  Now there's competing dispensaries in the Illinois side of the border.  It's finally come full circle.
@RhubarbTheBear They call then "Olds" for a reason. I feel like everyone has one of them hidden in their basement.
@RhubarbTheBear I guess technically all Bobby Shews are Z's but not all Z's are Bobby Shews hahaha
@RhubarbTheBear Neato is that a custom Z or a bobby Shew?
@KrilBear You did call me out lmao
@beckdoesthings @VazDrae @AzureusBat The fact this had more than one total episode disgusts me to my core

IRL + SUIT + ART + VR  (I did it :D) https://t.co/zbXEkM09Qp
@WolfgangDoghous @beckdoesthings Hey man you have your principle and you stand by it. Mad respect
@BlahtheOtter I mean that's what they're trying to do here so....I guess you're dropping it?
@Solaxee THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
@Firr I will be frank, I do my best to actively stay out of the modder community. So I don't know much about melon loader besides what I've been heard in passing so I trust your opinion on that over mine.
@Firr Then let's do both. They're both harmful. Let's try to fox both solutions
@kulzae By saying "it happens everywhere" I just see you saying "it's fine" but it's not fine. We can try and stop it we should
@thesaucem I want them to come at me COME AT ME BOTS
At the end of the day this is a "damned if they do, damned if they don't" thing and their choosing their players who don't break their "rules"
It's not about the QOL stuff or the fun little things. It's those programs using your data to steal shit without you knowing. Believe me I'll be the first to criticize VRC. 10$ a month is down right offensive and their game breaking every weekend is laughable at this point
So many people who have these custom models are too afraid to even use them and that SUCKKKS. Its like you buy a fursuit and someone could just download a copy of it and wear it around. You'd be heart broken.
It baffles me if you're actively going against a games rules (even if you disagree with it and that's ok) and get banned for it how shocked people are that they are getting banned.
My model that I spent months trying to find a good maker, a lot of money on and waited for it now all over the internet because people with mods. It's heart breaking to see and if VRC is trying to do something about it, I'm all for it.
Amazon making fake bot accounts to describe their OVERWHELMING love of condiments is hilarious. Gosh y'all need to get it together.
@Tirrelous @beherit Perfect
@traxhyena This is really cute I love this
@AuraAkita Honestly I dont think I'm mentally prepared for that again.
@beckdoesthings I mean ofc I'll unfollow someone shitty. it's the like "hey you're following this person" in a public tweet is weird as fuck.
@baebertooth @ItsBrendaBanks True, but it doesn't devalue this one.l?  But I can by your first post you're clearly not reading what I'm trying to say
I wish the wolf face meme had a hashtag with them so I can search it. I'm really into it
@AuraAkita Honestly I'll be suprised if either B or T will be alive in 2024 lmao
@whiskeyrodent @EdBCollie I barely agree with the DM thing. Like it's not your job or anyone elses to police my or any ones follow list.
@JaiyDaWoof I even hate that but at least it's not public.
Conservatives: A business should be able to refuse service to make a cake for a gay wedding.  Ok so a business should be able to refuse service to someone who isn't vaccinated then.  Concervatives: ... wait... no
@Fuzzy_DunIop @AlexBerenson @MrPink_Live FUCK I didn't expect to laugh this hard today. Good show dude
It's just like the dumbest childish shit to do and I'm not about seeing that come up on my timeline. There's like 123409 better ways to handle it including a nice DM.
"following" someone does not mean you endorse their behaviors/actions or hell even know about.  Calling someone out like "Hey @ you follow this person and they're "toxic" publicly is like THE most toxic behavior furry twitter finds acceptable for some reasons.
Whenever I see someone someone's blocked me. https://t.co/6tHleTl4ET
@K1NGRK9 @Monochrome_Fox_ I really enjoy how asking for room is "more work" than your 6 step process of pouring it in multiple cups lmao
@thesaucem I just wanna rent one for an hour use it on myself make a bunch of "look how hot i am" dad studfinder jokes. That's all I need.
@thesaucem I want one to mess around with it so bad. But they're super expensive
@Dragonfireny People don't consider them "animals" because they're not a dog/cat
Me everytime a "haha puffer fish literally dying" video is sent to me. https://t.co/iHEaITwg9p
@RavidWolf I mean it's been like two weeks and they haven't called me to just come pick it up and move it. Honestly really easy solution.
If we pay like a gazillion dollars for our stupid military at LEAST let us see some shit  Cmon
I'd pay payperview money to see them just blow it off the face of the planet https://t.co/EdloQnL3Fx
F https://t.co/DHH3xzeTCM
@PolyTheCougar @Kaijufus @fluffyshado @Vulpinous @PoxFox_ YOU don't get to say SHIT
