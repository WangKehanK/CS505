Hi https://t.co/8euWHakbd4
Thanks Polk County for yesterday’s online #2021townhall graciously hosted by the @PolkIONews in its newsroom. A true #OregonWay discussion during my 10th town hall over the past few days. With the help of @PeoplesTH, I look forward to even more town halls ahead throughout Oregon. https://t.co/BH8xEvearz
After another privacy disaster from Facebook it's clearer than ever that we need strong privacy legislation like my Mind Your Own Business Act. Companies won't take these breaches seriously until CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg are held personally responsible. https://t.co/R0pT00XRWx
Heard today from my friend Ib at @cafesoriah in Eugene how PPP loans &amp; aid for restaurants helped to keep the doors open at eateries just like his. Proud to have worked w/ @RepPeterDeFazio to get small restaurants across Oregon a seat at the table in the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/Cku9Ze0cRy
Energized by all I saw today at my alma mater with everything underway at the @UOKnightCampus to continue building Eugene &amp; @uoregon into a world-class research hub. A shining star in our state’s universe of opportunities. https://t.co/pNIyMOTmSE
Independent pharmacies like Michelle Belcher’s Grants Pass Pharmacy play a key role in getting Oregonians vaccinated. Good to see yesterday in Grants Pass how vaccination aid from the American Rescue Plan is making a difference here in southern Oregon. https://t.co/ne6uUSgrdq
Big thanks to Josie &amp; Hugh at the @GPJOChamber for letting me pop open my laptop here in Grants Pass for today’s online #2021townhall in Josephine County. And special thanks to my new four-legged friend Rogue for the southern Oregon hospitality https://t.co/AcygETBnP8
Very impressed with the #OregonWay ingenuity here in Medford at La Clinica, which converted this space once used for car repair into a community health site for COVID care. Great job by these health care heroes in southern Oregon. https://t.co/nIl0d1I5pM
Heard today during my latest visit to southern Oregon about the ongoing need to remove debris from the Almeda Fire so families can be back in stable home situations here in Talent and Phoenix. I’ll keep working w/ @FEMA, state &amp; local officials to make that happen ASAP. https://t.co/WVc0ST1NDE
Saw today how La Clinica Community Health Center here in Medford is putting American Rescue Plan resources to great use with vaccinations that provide a major dose of hope for southern Oregon. Huge thanks to all the volunteers nationwide working hard to get our country vaccinated https://t.co/tILBywNVoM
Thanks very much to the @HeraldandNews &amp; @PeoplesTH for helping to make the conversation happen
Klamath &amp; Lake counties proved again during yesterday’s online #2021townhall here in southern Oregon that the #OregonWay is thriving with a great discussion covering Klamath Basin water issues, wildfires, recreation, aid for counties &amp; tribes in the American Rescue Plan &amp; more. https://t.co/MS8XE2HQ5W
Thanks to @skylakes_org for today’s briefing on the latest with how the health center is battling COVID here in Klamath Falls &amp; southern Oregon. You truly are health care heroes. https://t.co/k7tJ3582TX
Heard today from Klamath Basin leaders like Kurt Thomas at his ranch here in Chiloquin about water issues facing the region. Thanks very much to Kurt for the hospitality and the education. https://t.co/c361eQ3dKS
If Republicans are actually interested in ensuring mega-corporations pay their fair share — not just punishing perceived enemies that support voting rights — then let's start with closing loopholes that allow companies to stash their profits in tax havens. https://t.co/qtM8jwarAx
Last night’s #2021townhall for Deschutes County made clear again that affordable/accessible housing is a key concern. Thanks to @thebulletin &amp; @PeoplesTH for helping me connect here in Bend on this topic as well as on infrastructure, vaccines, water use, gun violence, &amp; more. https://t.co/pgDjjdLTJJ
On this day in 1933, FDR established the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping get Americans back to work and preserving our most treasured natural spaces. @RepJoeNeguse and I say: Bring it back to #BuildBackBetter https://t.co/DoIQ1kz3hS
Here’s more about the legislation, which would protect about 4,700 miles of Oregon rivers/streams, safeguard private property/water rights &amp; strengthen wildfire protections in river corridors statewide: https://t.co/1SnaExHYjd
A beautiful day here in Central Oregon by Tumalo Creek with students from Pacific Crest Middle School and Bend High School as well as other local recreation fans who submitted some of the 15,000 nominations for my River Democracy Act. https://t.co/6jKJwqpXzu
Visited the Minoru Yasui Memorial Garden this weekend in Hood River honoring this Oregon hero who devoted his life to #StopAsianHate. The best way to honor his memory is to end anti-Asian discrimination in Oregon &amp; everywhere. https://t.co/Q3UEf0QDSN
It's past time mega-corporations pay their fair share in taxes and create good-paying jobs in the United States. I have the plan to do it. https://t.co/QQIrg2zeH5
Great conversations at this morning’s #2021townhall in Jefferson County about water infrastructure, online learning, rural broadband, cannabis equity, vote-by-mail &amp; more. A big thank you to @KWSO Warm Springs Radio for your generous hospitality. https://t.co/1dS4ku3XFg
As America builds back better, Oregonians in my #2021townhalls often remind me that we must invest in infrastructure — roads, bridges, affordable housing, accessible childcare &amp; more. Thanks to @PortofHoodRiver for hosting today’s great online townhall here in Hood River County. https://t.co/hu9SRiXBPv
My online #2021townhalls continue today from Hood River County with the help of @PeoplesTH. Here’s how to participate in that town hall and five more throughout Oregon over the next few days: https://t.co/7mZEfXdqfk
Big thanks to @headlightherald publisher Joe Warren for loaning me his office in Tillamook for yesterday’s virtual #2021townhall for Tillamook County hosted by @PeoplesTH. Community journalism &amp; town halls where Oregonians can ask any question are both big parts of the #OregonWay https://t.co/2pTR0SnEQw
Heard loud &amp; clear during yesterday’s #2021townhall in Lincoln County about the need to speed up debris removal from the Echo Mountain Fire. I will keep pressing FEMA to accelerate the debris clean-up needed for a full recovery from this devastating fire. https://t.co/5GcoMPiGaT
Received some wonderful Lincoln County hospitality yesterday in Newport at the News Times, which was good enough to host my online #2021townhall while I was on the coast. Good #OregonWay discussion with county residents about federal aid for fisheries, fire recovery &amp; more. https://t.co/8tqVqyWTVL
My heart aches for the loss of Officer Evans and for his loved ones and colleagues in the aftermath of today’s attack. Every person working in and around the Capitol is a public servant in a public place who put their lives on the line each day – this violence should stop.
The Republican tax cuts are doing exactly what they were designed to do: let mega-corporations off the hook while hard working Americans pay their fair share. As Chairman of @SenateFinance I will fight tooth and nail to ensure corporations and billionaires pay their fair share. https://t.co/8ilMUGtPsy
Looking forward to two more virtual #2021townhalls today hosted by @PeoplesTH in Tillamook &amp; Lincoln counties as well as six more over the next week. Here’s how to tune in and ask questions: https://t.co/7mZEfXdqfk
Thanks @dhnews for lending me your conference room in Albany to hear from Linn County residents during yesterday’s online #2021townhall about the climate crisis; broadband and child care as a must for infrastructure; Social Security; prescription drug prices &amp; more. https://t.co/p2UEebKMfc
Can’t say enough good things about the fish &amp; chips at Nana’s Irish Pub in Newport. Looking forward to tomorrow’s virtual town hall in Lincoln County. https://t.co/IhRrv3cBrU
Democrats promised to protect and expand access to affordable health care, and help is here. This is a big first step to help Americans get the coverage they need, and we will keep fighting to ensure access to quality care for every American. https://t.co/PWIMRwkTcK
Building back better includes hardening infrastructure for emergencies like a potential Cascadia earthquake in Oregon &amp; the West Coast. Glad to have secured funding for ShakeAlert warning links like the one I visited today in Albany that provide valuable seconds for quake prep. https://t.co/Lz1XZKnN7D
Here’s more about our legislation to support a natural resource management/conservation workforce, and bolster wildfire prevention/preparedness to protect communities here in Oregon and nationwide: https://t.co/z1vGyDyXJF
The picture today of @NWYouthCorps members working hard on fire prevention in Oregon by reducing hazardous fuels here in Eugene’s South Hills is exactly what my 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps Act with @RepJoeNeguse aims to replicate nationwide. https://t.co/lJegaHXGIV
Very impressed by all I heard and saw last evening in Eugene at @kidsports4life with how @OregonWBB icon Bev Smith and her team are making a real difference for so many young Oregonians by providing them a place to play here at Civic Park. https://t.co/KAvlZGZYNX
When it comes to putting rural communities back to work and protecting our outdoor spaces, @POTUS Biden and I are in agreement. The two go hand in hand, and this is a good first step to getting it done. https://t.co/gA9vyf4GbZ
Glad the IRS has figured out a solution to refund money to workers who filed their taxes before the #AmericanRescuePlan was signed into law. This change that I worked to get included in the package will safeguard up to $10,200 in unemployment benefits from surprise tax bills. https://t.co/70Jnut9Ike
Good https://t.co/b6i7OU2MgD
This proposal will make once-in-a-generation investments in the American people. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure means building a better future for our children. I look forward to working with the Biden administration to get these priorities across the finish line. https://t.co/cFOVlLJTXV
Big thanks to the @BendChamber for letting me Zoom in from Portland today to answer questions about how the American Rescue Plan will help small businesses in Central Oregon &amp; nationwide. https://t.co/I5vZMEG7M1
Congratulations to Haleigh on being Oregon’s first woman ROTC-trained infantry officer. This is a true example of Oregon excellence. https://t.co/eO3aNPnFrn
As Democrats look to bring America’s infrastructure into the 21st century, we have a unique opportunity to bridge the digital divide. I’m working with the @FCC to prioritize the expansion of rural broadband so every American has access to the digital resources they need. https://t.co/ck1L5crXDc
What a great #MarchMadness run for @BeaversMBB. One tough loss in the Elite 8 will never erase the wonderful memories Coach Tinkle and the entire team made for Beavers believers here in Oregon &amp; everywhere. #GoBeavs
Today my friend Bob told me he pioneered Employee Stock Ownership at @BobsRedMill because a shared stake in a company’s success benefits everyone from the stockroom to the boardroom. Great to visit this Oregon institution here in Clackamas County. https://t.co/dOtB6guURU
Thanks Clackamas County for today’s standout online #2021townhall. A true #OregonWay conversation about finding smart solutions that improve infrastructure, reduce prescription drug prices, fight wildfires, combat the climate crisis &amp; more. https://t.co/sS4k9ZaUIo
After the latest attack on civilians by Burma’s military junta, @USTradeRep is right to send the message that America won’t go ahead with business as usual. I applaud this and other actions by the Biden administration to impose consequences on this brutal regime. https://t.co/l7Wd9vSnU4
Happy to see the Blue River Post Office is closer than ever to getting back &amp; running in the McKenzie River Valley. I’ll continue working hard on this and all other critical efforts to ensure a speedy and complete recovery from the Holiday Farm Fire. https://t.co/h2oEgy51lT
Thanks to help from @PeoplesTH, tomorrow is the first of my upcoming 10 virtual #2021townhalls. Check out the full schedule and instructions on how to watch &amp; submit your questions: https://t.co/7mZEfXdqfk
Oregon is leading the way in developing collaborative, more humane ways to help people in mental health crisis situations. Thanks to @PDXFire for its leadership in helping make these common-sense ideas a reality. #OregonWay https://t.co/Aat2HEHqnk
Tomorrow is Minoru Yasui Day here in Oregon. A well-earned honor for this hero who championed civil &amp; human rights in our state. As our country works to #StopAsianHate this trailblazer deserves recognition every day: https://t.co/p3tJZepSKY
Grant Park here in NE Portland has many wonderful reminders of how Beverly Cleary drew from her childhood home to capture young readers’ hearts &amp; minds. While we mourn this iconic Oregonian’s passing, we also are thankful for her timeless contribution to kids’ literature. https://t.co/BHjyL6XECi
Heard powerful accounts today at @ahscpdx from local #AAPI leaders about the awful hate speech &amp; hate crimes their communities face. The message today &amp; every day must be no tolerance for racism and bias here in Portland, in Oregon &amp; our entire country. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/ajccLGT2eY
Gratified to get a down payment in the American Rescue Plan to help groundbreaking local efforts like this one in Portland and the longstanding CAHOOTS program by @WhiteBirdClinic in Eugene. Working to provide even more help w/this bill: https://t.co/znNtDhOrzo
Thanks to @JoAnnPDX &amp; the entire @PDXStResponse for today’s briefing on the initial rollout of their work here in southeast PDX to provide a more humane response to people facing mental health challenges. https://t.co/suecOrrZDw
Democrats made a massive down-payment to expand rural broadband in the last relief package. Today I'm introducing legislation to ensure that families who rely on broadband the most don’t lose access just as our country can see the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The numbers don't lie: going big on relief to help Americans survive this crisis is working. https://t.co/yZ2u9zvX9K
The lesson of the Republican tax law is that you can shower corporations with hundreds of billions in handouts and fail to produce a lasting boost to American jobs and investment. https://t.co/UZ5RXurEOp
Starting in April, eligible Americans who have lost a loved one to COVID-19 can now get FEMA help to cover funeral costs. Learn more about how to get help easing the financial burden of losing a loved one to this virus: https://t.co/j1G3JO8OHD
It's unconscionable that in 2021 women are still forced to demand equal pay for equal work. I will be fighting tooth and nail to make sure this is the last #EqualPayDay without the Paycheck Fairness Act.
American companies shouldn't be a tool of authoritarian governments seeking to suppress dissent. I agree the U.S. must fight back against Turkey, China and other repressive regimes to defend free expression online. https://t.co/ihBPDn2BCg
Huge congratulations to @linamkhan on this well-deserved honor. Her expertise and voice will be critical in the fight to hold Big Tech accountable for abusing Americans’ privacy. I look forward to voting for her confirmation. https://t.co/wf05HRXhbe
After four years of chaos and divisiveness at OMB, Shalanda Young is exactly the kind of experienced and dedicated leader we need in this agency to guide the future of our country. I look forward to voting for her confirmation today. https://t.co/K54Cukb5sj
Every time, we say "never again", and every time, we're wrong. It's past time for real action to enact common-sense gun reforms. Democrats must bring gun reform legislation to the floor of the Senate ASAP. https://t.co/gGAsP1csN6
11 years ago, Democrats took bold action to expand access to quality, affordable health care for American families. Today, we remain just as committed to that mission and will do everything in our power to advance the fight for affordable care — for every American.
With @BeaverWBB, @BeaverMBB &amp; @OregonMBB all winning their #MarchMadness games, there’s no doubt our state is giving the college hoops universe a run for its money. Looking forward to @OregonWBB continuing the run tonight. #GoDucks #GoBeavs
.@JaneLubchenco has an outstanding history at @OregonState &amp; @NOAA as a “bionic woman of science.” Great to see her write another chapter this #WomensHistoryMonth in her new @WHOSTP role fighting the climate crisis. https://t.co/d2Ha7CjtM8
A wonderful and thoughtful voice in Oregon journalism has been lost with the passing of Beth Hyams. My deepest condolences to Beth’s family, friends and colleagues at @OPB. She will be hugely missed: https://t.co/cEDCPfWxLZ
.@sedonaprince_ is exactly right. This #MarchMadness inequality is shameful. Do better, @NCAA. #GoDucks #GoBeavs https://t.co/3P0HyfWzcN
Congrats to the @HighDesertMuse for earning this well-deserved honor from the @US_IMLS This museum is a genuine treasure for residents in Central Oregon and everybody who visits this special part of our state: https://t.co/n3haFJs25C
I have no doubt Najiah Knight will soon be a household name in Oregon and beyond. I can’t wait to watch this talented, young Oregonian make history. https://t.co/cSfP9lSbaL
This week’s @SenateFinance hearing shed light on the heartbreaking realities of those on the frontlines of this pandemic. I won't stop fighting tooth and nail to address these failures and keep America's seniors safe.
The collision of mismanagement with chronic understaffing and lousy infection control in nursing homes caused thousands of Americans, both residents and caregivers, to suffer and die while families were kept in the dark. https://t.co/l0woUVdhFH
Stimulus checks are starting to hit bank accounts but there are millions left to distribute that are vulnerable to being snatched up by predatory debt collectors. That’s why it’s critical that my bill with @SenSherrodBrown be passed ASAP to safeguard checks. https://t.co/Yjvv35vhwN
It’s past time to end the federal prohibition of cannabis and the failed, racist War on Drugs. @SenBooker @SenSchumer and I are all in to get it done. https://t.co/5KQ0YnLU75
Glad to have @SenatorWarnock in the Senate to continue the fight to protect voting rights as Republicans nationwide chip away at a Americans’ constitutional right to vote. #ProtectTheVote https://t.co/JC5oDPnYE6
The increase in hate crimes against the Asian American community in the United States shows once again how far our country has to go to defeat racism and intolerance. I stand with our AAPI neighbors in Oregon and nationwide to #StopAAPIHate. https://t.co/Rg4rXiLd9v
The Trump administration failed to keep America's nursing homes safe from #COVID19, and our nation's seniors are paying the price. As Chairman of @SenateFinance I will use the full weight of our committee to address these failures and keep our seniors safe. https://t.co/LeFxLNBgwc
.@SenatorBennet @SenStabenow and I are working on comprehensive legislation to do just that. As chairman of @SenateFinance this will be one of my top priorities, and I'm all in to get it across the finish line.
Investments in manufacturing and clean energy must be the foundation of our country's long-term economic recovery. It's time to invest resources to help American manufacturers expand while creating good-paying jobs that support workers.
.@DebHaalandNM is qualified, dedicated, and making history. She’s ready to hit the ground running and get to work for the American people. https://t.co/SZ1kZiFAF5
Great to catch up this weekend in Astoria after my online Clatsop County #2021townhall with my friend Bob Rees &amp; hear how PPP and PUA have helped keep his fishing guide business along with others like it in Oregon afloat. https://t.co/KeC7WN5LQf
Thanks again to the @DailyAstorian for hosting my online #2021townhall this weekend with Clatsop County &amp; also to @PeoplesTH for helping to keep these #OregonWay conversations alive &amp; thriving.  https://t.co/jFkke1xm6O
Equity was a big theme of today’s #2021TownHall here in Clatsop County. Long story short: #BlackLivesMatter. And to build back a better and more equitable Oregon, Oregonians are counting on Congress for policing reform, rental assistance, lower prescription drug prices &amp; more. https://t.co/OR4msf2vEL
Nobody would mistake me for @Dame_Lillard but that doesn’t stop me from getting a few practice shots in after a long plane ride home to #RipCity. https://t.co/nZkOsdCes2
Details here about how to watch and ask questions: https://t.co/LuJxpMuzQc
Eager to have open-to-all town halls as soon as it’s safe but until then with the help of @PeoplesTH, tune into my virtual #2021townhalls like tomorrow’s in Clatsop County. https://t.co/rajL0NFy0O
The privacy of consumers shouldn't depend on senators playing whack-a-mole with companies. Americans need strong privacy laws enforcing a simple opt-out of ALL corporate tracking. My Mind Your Own Business Act does just that, and I won’t stop fighting to get it passed.
