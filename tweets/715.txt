If you don’t give a damn then I don’t give a fuck
Like I’m telling you my family actively tried to educate us on the culture. I went to Indian festivals, we had dream catchers in every bedroom, and my mom took us to museums and bought us books too. Now I got all this appreciation for Native Americans and I’m fucking Irish 😂
Soo my grandma told us growing up that our heritage was Native American. We studied the culture, embodied it, visited reservations and she even told us what tribe we belong to. Then two years ago my mom took an ancestry test and found out she lied and we were straight Irish 🙃
Finally filed my taxes Lord please bless me w a fat ass check 😭🙏🏻
If Indy bitches wasn’t so weird lol https://t.co/DhzoaE01QN
Surround yourself with people that motivate you to do better
I’m so blessed to have a best friend that is always on the same mental growth as me... Larissa and I just had a talk about how we’re applying serious changes to our lives so we can grow and it bring tears to my eyes seeing how serious we both are. I’m so excited for our growth
So tired of doing things for people that wouldn’t do the same for me.
Outta sight outta mind
