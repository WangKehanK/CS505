@camijustice 😬
@SirYacht Easily Justin Gilbert. Corey Coleman is up there as well.
@Carlitos1233r4 @CLEsportsTalk Ward will probably be gone after this year tbh.
@barstoolindy Thank god for that day!!
@LWIAY_bot More like ten times
@Browniestalk Progressive Field should be Jacob’s Field, and those boxes out in the right field upper deck are hideous.
@artg213 @DolansThoughts Everyone wanted him back, he was one of the 4 guys who could hit the ball last year.
@Ernieclem @Indians That’s the problem, they are playing the wrong sport!!
THE REFS ARE RIGGING THIS GAME 100%, HOLY SH*T. #MarchMadness
White dude on Gonzaga celebrating like the refs aren’t in his pocket. #MarchMadness
These refs are so bad in this game🤦🏻‍♂️ #UCLAvsGONZ
@BarstoolBigCat Bruce’s best shows were when he used to do Sunday night after Browns games. He always got drunk callers after incredible losses that the Browns used to produce.
@sportingnews @Monte_Colorman I love Bruce, but this guy is right about the past couple of years. The owner won’t pay to get any bats in the lineup. Reyes is fine, but having Chang, Bauers, and Luplow in the starting lineup is a joke.
@John_Fanta @pittsburghsux75 He’s right though. The team can’t hit like always. This isn’t just one game, it has been like this for a couple of years.
@jontaffer @jackkellz201 I know it is a joke, but I would be for it 100%!! America Rescue activated!
@SirYacht 🤦🏻‍♂️
@nats_sportschat @elprez95 @SInow If he hits a homerun every at bat maybe we will win half of our games.
@chadp71 Nope, the helmet stays the same.
@barstoolsports @SpinninBackfist He had 30 pounds on him and a longer reach. Stipe didn’t stand a chance.
@CLEsportsTalk Worst organization in sports
@Indians @PapaPlut09 F*ck this franchise. Don’t change the name, move the team.
@ryaxh7x @espn Insecure mf
@BarstoolBigCat Cocomelon diss track by Pewdiepie called Coco is on Spotify. https://t.co/lGHTC58GM1
@Arobzz_ How is Age of Ultron on top?
@sportsmedicated @PFF The guy threw 20 touchdowns and only 3 interceptions in the last 11 games of last season. Plus led the Browns to their first playoff win since the 90s. Lay off the guy.
@CBSSportsHQ @Reflog_18 @Colebehr_report *people complaining about a pandemic that won’t affect these kids in the least bit*
Bad coaching by Ohio State, how don’t you give the ball to Liddell in that situation? Jesus Christ🤦🏻‍♂️ #NCAATournament
@DisavowTrump20 Trump didn’t fall and could talk for hours on end, Biden’s foundation as a person is crumbling apart.
@newbietuwbie @Gatewaityyf @LWIAY_bot He has lived in America his entire life. There’s people of all different races in America, that doesn’t make them non-Americans.
@KronkMMA @chadp71 You’re high asf if you think he sucks.
@RapSheet The most underrated player in the league.
@Jake_Trotter Praying for that LB!!🙏🏼
@asapjeylani @taywinter_17 We would all need rehab centers to get off technology. It is so fucked🤦🏻‍♂️
@BIGPLAYReflog @Reflog_18 @shacknews Ogunjobi for sure. I love Higgins though.
@RapSheet The Browns let a solid player go.
@GoodJuJuGuru What a clown show😂😂
@IndianaSteveB Hold those L’s for the rest of your life as a Steelers fan
@clebrownsntwork This team is quietly falling apart.
Ohio State will never accept an easy win, but it’s March Madness baby! Go Bucks!! #OSUvsMICH
@Patricia_Traina @BrandonLittleSI First go 1-15 and 0-16, and then pick the right first picks of the draft. Then with the multitude of money you still haven’t spent, because you have good first contract players, you can spend on good veterans.
@SirYacht Big Time Rush only has bangers.
@985WNCX Hard Die the Heroes💔
@FredZinkieMLB The Browns offensive line was trash in 2019, and Nick Chubb still ran for the second most yards in the league.
@Browniestalk Stuff like that started the change🙌🏼
@PaulBrown_UK They need defense. The offense is all good except for Higgins, who needs to be resigned.
@heheitsmelingy I’m confused about this whole thing😂
@heheitsmelingy Why though?
@SirYacht On another note, Primanti Bros is some high quality food though.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro Bill Burr is a legend
@AP “The Woke/cancel culture attacks best children’s book author of all time”
@EricFrazier2 This is ridiculous!!
@LWIAY_bot I just hate that he isn’t standing up for himself.
@enews We all drive faster than what’s expected lmao.
Prayers for my favorite athlete ever, @TigerWoods 🙏🏼😞
@JLEWFifty @Indians @FOXSportsCLE @AlPawlowski They need to sign a right fielder.
@therealinformer Norm is the best
Sueing with that turnover he had blew the whole game open for Michigan. #MICHvsOSU
@Browniestalk I think about this almost everyday
@SirYacht Jordan is obviously the greatest ever.
@CBoTheEggman @baseballcrank @benshapiro When Lincoln became President it started a war.
@CBSSports Indians blown 3-1 lead
@holly_johnson16 As a Gen Z member, I will be voting for Trump again.
@clebrownsntwork LB. They have literal garbage at LB.
@10centBeerNite He is easilythe best player on the team when he plays well.
@christinemooo @CFBONFOX @StanfordFball @oregonfootball @LSUfootball @OhioStateFB @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @GeorgiaFootball @OU_Football @CowboyFB They don’t
@ASCSportsMedia @Lj_era8 @bakermayfield Well, Baker is an actual QB, so he’s better.
@SethAbramson “Insurrection”😂 just because a few Antifa and other crazies got through because of horrible security. This is the biggest joke ever.
@thebradfordfile Because Trump got the second most votes of all time.
@Judson4Congress Brainwash central😂
@MylesLGarrett Minecraft!!
@Aaron_Torres No neck Torres uses fighting words.
Bruce Springsteen doesn’t know the first thing about Kansas. The guy is from New Jersey for god sakes. #SuperBowl
@PaulBrown_UK It was good. I usually hate it, but the songs were actually good.
@DevotedBrownie It’s a nice jersey.
@SirYacht They are getting what they deserve. Plus, they are idiots.
@Mz2euceBOSS Cringe post
GRONK SCORED, LETS GO!! #SBLV
@MJKolhoff @BakersDawgs Him getting Covid ruined his year
@Reflog_18 It is ridiculous that they play at Michigan this year even though they never played them last year at the Shoe.
@PaulBrown_UK Couldn’t be worse than Stewart Jr.
@CarmensCrew I-O!!
@BarstoolOSU The refs should be in high school
@chasshill @11W This game is fixed tonight
@tribeinsider He better not make the team🤦🏻‍♂️
@snider_wx Akron, Canton, Youngstown, Sandusky, Medina, etc
@handurha @MAnime9001 You need a lesson on being a decent person.
@DolansThoughts They do need a right fielder. It would only make sense.
@gabbgoudy @Baker6szn You’re on crack
This is embarrassing for the #Cavs tonight. I haven't seen such little effort in a ball game in a long time.
@JoeyMulinaro ‘Awesome God’ got snubbed🤦🏻‍♂️
@kissmytoe_ I don’t remember too well, but I think other people did that one. I’m not sure, it was like 4 or 5 years ago.
@kissmytoe_ He didn’t hire the people, other people did. It was a bad joke, and the n word thing was an obvious mistake and he has apologized and has payed for it. You can’t judge the man forever though. He has improved himself so much since those things.
