@ARUGULAP0P @Saint2222_ 😕
@ANDRO_DYKE the journey pushes you to your limits. It’s a lot of crying, getting hurt, and healing and growing.
@ANDRO_DYKE this journey triggers the hell out of you. It’s not about meeting the love of your life and being happy together, though that can happen after healing and self-growth. It’s about becoming the best version of yourself and aligning with your path. And in order for that to happen,
if you’re not on this journey be thankful. give thanks for your peace of mind and sanity.
man.... this twin flame stuff is NOT for the weak. what i just witnessed would’ve honestly killed me a year ago but thankfully i’m not that person anymore
