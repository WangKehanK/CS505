random thought of the day: since everyone has to wear masks to school, are there still those kids that everyone hated that stand in the hallways and makeout ?

@Hayvenj2 @jaelyntracy
@Hayvenj2 @mikayla_nadia

@melanimgarcia this is why you don’t have people you work with on social media
i’m single because i don’t put out the first time i meet a guy and i guess that’s a bad thing🤷‍♀️
i just cleared out all my social media and got rid of people i don’t need on there and i feel so much better
@macedillaa congratulations! i’m so happy for both of you!!
@raenicollee @melanimgarcia @mikayla_nadia absolutely!!
being in love with someone you can’t have is literally the worst.
is it be an asshole to Callie today ?
@OTG_Coffee @robyn_kailene
i just wanna be cuddled up watching netflix
i leave for PA tomorrow morning and i’m honestly so excited to meet all of mikayla’s friends!
@mikayla_nadia i’m so ready!
i don’t even know who you are anymore.

four years have gone by and it still doesn’t feel real i don’t go a day without thinking about you... i miss you hunter 💙
mik: Men are trash dude: If men are trash y’all are raccoons  me:FACT!

i’m a broke college student with bills piling up and didn’t get a stimulus check. i work full time and juggle being a full time student along with it. i wouldn’t even use the money for myself. i’d give it to my mom so it can help her get a house for her and my brother. https://t.co/XNrHRAdJkn
