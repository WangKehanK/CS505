@andrew__1995 I always say the same thing! He’s well known, yet underrated (I know that’s kinda contradicting). His Southpaw performance was incredible. I honestly don’t think he’s reached his peak just yet tbh.
@joyfulseaveyy Right?! I love Christian, but this ain’t it. I hope everyone starts to understand why this issue is so important
@joyfulseaveyy I hope he deletes this tweet 😂 because I can’t deal with Trisha defenders anymore
@joyfulseaveyy Exactly, she’s been in the game so long she knows how to work the system. No one can tell me otherwise!
@joyfulseaveyy YES! This what I try to tell people omg.
@katelyn_knj @Seavey_Chris it seems like everyone always defends her for it! I agree with you wholeheartedly. I’m glad she exposed people that need it, but let’s hold her accountable too
People really think because it’s a new year, there’s no more COVID-19
@jaeduhmayy @AmaniCapalot And the fact that the original tweet went viral is more upsetting. Thousands of people coming at one individual who did nothing to them. I hope he’s doing okay 🤍
@iSmellSexNCandE okay I get what you mean! And now I can kind of see it from Leroy’s mind. I guess I was just confused with the timing of it all
@iSmellSexNCandE Bananas isn’t here this time so I don’t think Leroy had much to worry about...am I making sense? Lol
honestly trying to understand why Leroy put up Wes? Lol I mean say what you want about Wes, but he’s right....he has never actually targeted Leroy ever I don’t think.   #TheChallenge36
@dadabritney @jksbIunt @nycgirllauren @silkshobi Lol and what blows my mind is Meech ended up being the one to gain a bigger audience when honestly he isn’t that funny. I’m not trying to pit friends against each other, but come on now nobody can’t tell me dope island doesn’t deserve more 😭
🥺 https://t.co/NVy8ya9vOK
@ladyaarion @lnternetstorm @workingoncrying Lol during her tumblr days didn’t she make a song about Harry while pretending to be Taylor Swift...or am I making this up?
@JarettSays I’m sorry, but Jada needs to be quiet for this one. Gram is absolutely right
@MeelzTV Omg I have 3: 1. Sometimes 2. I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman 3. Circus
@JakeWebber9 Not “Goof Juice”! 😭
@carpeDEE_m @ctc_1227 @DiondreBeats Yes! Lol on the weekends I would randomly wake up in the middle of the night with my tv still on Disney Channel and that movie would be on 😂
@Mrs__Webber @sncvstw Yes! Lol And TKO means “Technical Knock Out”
@Marx_Dela Right?! 😂😂😂
@Marx_Dela I agree! I watched her house tour on YouTube and she seems pretty low maintenance (well in rich people terms 😂) compared to her family.
@ZacharyMichaels @MackquanS @SerotoninSimp @Pete_3000 @Snow_Blacck 😂 we might all be dumb then because I read it wrong as well
This has got to be one of the weirdest Thanksgivings ever lol but I’m also glad my family is taking this pandemic seriously
@MissSneed And if I remember correctly, I believe his family members pretty much shunned him for having her back.
@MashItGaming @meepiestbeep Oh wow okay now I definitely gotta look into all of this lol
@meepiestbeep What?!?! Omg I didn’t know that 😮
@BuzzingPop Britney Spears Circus album! 🤍
@aras2990 😂 I understood it was a joke. I’m sorry people came at you lol
@aras2990 The fact that so many people took this comment seriously lol
noooooo. I hope Jesy is doing okay 🤍 #LittleMix
@ULTRALIGHTGUCCI this ain’t it
@bitchbi45 @RedBedroomRcrds Right?! 😂 thats the only thing I can think of
@bitchbi45 @RedBedroomRcrds She pretty much dismissed black women as a way to lift up Latina women regarding the election. I’d also like to include that to my knowledge no one even asked for her opinion about black women lol so I’m so confused why she felt the need to do that.
Eva Longoria really pulled a Gina Rodriguez.
The fact that people are really believing this voter fraud mess is so entertaining. Trump need to just take this L
Anyone who starts off with, “I never speak about politics but...” is about to be on some lame mess
@endlesslovedols @JosephMorgan This literally made me gasp 😮
@exilehive Troy the type to vote for Biden, but tells everyone “it’s okay to disagree and be friends” while he is friends with Trump supporters.
@ChrisEvans @CEvansNews 🤍
I love this! 😂 https://t.co/cBZrlbtW7e
@JakeWebber9 Jake...I-  omg I don’t even know what to say 😮
Ashley Tisdale is the queen of pop
@zoesaldana @prattprattpratt She really quoted Tupac for Chris Pratt??? 😂
I may be the only one who wasn’t big on Ariana’s last two albums 😭but I’m excited to see how #AG6 will be. I’m hoping for straight r&amp;b lol
@Mutsa_Mhende When I was younger I legit thought my cousin’s cousin was also my cousin 😂
For someone who isn’t guilible I always seem to fall for pick up lines 😂
Story of my life 😭 https://t.co/ug89ENAEBG
I still get annoyed at everyone who voted for him 🙄 he’s just another Trump https://t.co/5dTGxsV99g
Nonblack people...if you have a black friend please do not ask them how can you be an ally. It’s annoying. You see what’s going on and you should know right from wrong. Just show up and be genuine about it.
@lovelyelijahx Christdemeanor 😭😭😭😭
@zaynmalik 😮 I’m getting r&amp;b vibes omg I love this!
@cHr1sSyNuLl Yep! And in an interview I think it was last year she said she loves and misses him so it’s cool to see they still keep in touch
@WoaThatsIntense Also, I’m actually glad you took the time to stand up for the person with the original post!
@WoaThatsIntense Yes! I honestly did not mean any harm. I can’t speak on behalf of everyone else but I genuinely made an honest mistake by misreading the original post lol I feel like I got caught in the middle because of it 😂.
@deadgals Right?!?! And the fact that people are still willing to collab with her blows my mind.
@deadgals How many communities home girl trying to be apart of???
@WoaThatsIntense This is the only example that came to mind that I felt went hand in hand with your statement
@WoaThatsIntense I agree with this statement. some people aren’t liking when others say this pandemic has been a blessing in disguise. People disagree with it because they have lost loved ones or jobs due to it vs. those who haven’t. I’d never discredit that even though there are other aspects
@unixuserdtb @WoaThatsIntense @GhoulGrooves @JaneGosford This truly took a dark turn...
@WoaThatsIntense @GhoulGrooves @unixuserdtb @JaneGosford After learning my mistake about misreading the original post I do agree no one should discredit what they were upset about because it honestly is a valid reason.
@WoaThatsIntense @GhoulGrooves @unixuserdtb @JaneGosford Oh no I definitely was only confused because I thought the original post said olympics, not “special Olympics” which to me personally makes a huge difference and I made it known I misread it. So I admit being wrong on that part.
@WoaThatsIntense @GhoulGrooves @unixuserdtb @JaneGosford I’m not trying to be that annoying neutral person, but is it bad I understand each of everyone’s viewpoints? 😬 I genuinely understand both sides and can see where each of you are coming from
@spookyfacelift @Moisesibarrax2 @ItsZaeOk Only for those wack shoes to become trendy years later and that kid is still traumatized even as an adult. I’ve witnessed this before and it’s a shame some people just brush it off with the “popular crowd” just “kids being kids”
@spookyfacelift @Moisesibarrax2 @ItsZaeOk Ah that’s actually a very good point. I never thought of it that way to be honest.
@WoaThatsIntense @unixuserdtb @JaneGosford @GhoulGrooves Oh my...
@Moisesibarrax2 @ItsZaeOk Yes, in my opinion I think movies/tv made the term “popular”....well popular lol 😂but also tv/film kinda made it so that the “popular kids” were mostly mean rather than just social and because of that many people associate popular kids with being mean.
@IssaJade__ Completely agree! 😂 that’s actually what I was thinking as well after comparing the two tweets
@jackisbasic True!
@WoaThatsIntense Oh snap, okay I’m dumb I read over “Special Olympics” and only saw “Olympics” so them being upset about the statement makes more sense to me! Thank you for your response it gave me better insight on the issue
@AngryBlackLady Completely agree! Also, criticism doesn’t mean you are “hating” on them. There’s a difference.
@_blaque_fantasy I love him so much 😭
@MYSOSEITY soooo which tweet should I believe? Lol https://t.co/kQXF25N4Vn
@ItsZaeOk soooo which tweet should I believe? Lol https://t.co/ARf3Pr4bXv
Today I’ve learned people are okay with actors/actresses having love scenes with minors because it’s “acting”.
@RedBedroomRcrds Congratulations! 🥳 job hunting is so stressful during this pandemic so im happy to see this positive outcome!
Huh? https://t.co/lBYtJkeWay
@AJP0130 @Jessicaamaka_ @Asha09210716 Something was off about Andrea to me lol she gave off weird vibes 😂
@Arya37483317 lol idk why but I imagine one of his buddies saw it online and sent it to him and he saved it because he thought it was funny 😂
😬 https://t.co/uUpwXeOGUb
I can’t believe Chris Evans accidentally leaked his camera roll...this is why he never should’ve made an instagram, we all know he’s not tech savvy 😂
My mom looking at me crazy once I was done explaining why the movie #AfterWeCollidedMovie &amp; Anna Todd were toxic! 😂😂😂
NOOOOOOOOO....anything but my favorite movie 😭 https://t.co/pNyFxRo0kl
Yessss Osa!🔥 https://t.co/JvgZhzm6Li
Lost someone I knew due to COVID last night and I’m honestly so sad. The kindest person I’ve ever known. Today I’ve seen people on social media still treating this pandemic like it’s a joke. #WearAMask
@Chicagojewlz @ciaraelysew @SwaggyCTV @BayleighDaily I’m wishing you both the best! And I’m so glad I had this type of convo with two understanding strangers, it really puts things into perspective.
@Chicagojewlz @ciaraelysew @SwaggyCTV @BayleighDaily That’s honestly great and such a great trait to have. I try my best to be opened minded and I’m happy to see there are people that can politely explain different viewpoints. You’re awesome!
@ciaraelysew @Chicagojewlz @SwaggyCTV @BayleighDaily Exactly! I always say you can get your point across in a kind and polite way and she did that. Because when people are rude it just causes the convo to go south in my opinion lol and it’s cool to see you were open minded as well I feel like that’s so rare nowadays.
@ciaraelysew @Chicagojewlz @SwaggyCTV @BayleighDaily I love this convo! 💕 Honestly nice to see two people communicate in such a nice way regarding something that’s different from their own lifestyle.
I wish my neighbors wouldn’t mow their lawn at 8am every weekend 😭 I’m in need of earplugs
Still waiting for @dunkindonuts to send me a gift card so I can continue buying oat milk iced coffee’s 😛
@HanawellSadie @ayo_jerred 😂😂😂😂
@caitiedelaney The most RANDOM movie twist ever lol
@Dustwill23 @chad_siegfried @PaulCalafiore_ @JanellePierzina 😂😂😂 I had to reread his response to make sure I read correctly
