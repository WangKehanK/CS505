funny how people in Texas are “able to start living again” while they walk across those who died.

everytime my air conditioning in my house turns off i think my power has gone out  if that’s not ptsd, idk what is.
i like how we have stuff due online while there’s rolling blackouts.  that’s cool.
idk what’s worse when driving in snow:   an impatient jeep or truck fucking the backside of my car.

@megankulyas i know that’s a new concept for you
why does an A bring your GPA up by 0.2 but a C brings it down by 0.7. Who decided this?  Also, who made A- a thing in collegiate courses? what a useless and unfair metric.
adults should be bullied too.
the semester’s finally over and i didn’t kms, i’m proud.
@money_benz baylor hates charlie brewer this year, blame it on that lmao.
@money_benz we’re doing the best we can, okay?
@happyhappyhales mood
being in college means taking a C for a hard class and moving on with life :)
once again my top genre for the year on spotify was lo-fi because all i do is fucking study.
