@st0rmborn The way so many Americans have such an entitled attitude when they travel is ridiculous, it is not a an exaggeration when I saw we are the most obnoxious group of people to visit foreign countries and everyone hates us

@mr_mcnasty I didn’t know you bartered
@GneissBitch .....wtf
@GneissBitch And that’s so powerful! I literally refer to it as my superpower lol, not everyone has that ability and it’s really beautiful and I’m happy you can regard it as a strength and something that’s part of you c:
Being too sensitive, caring too much, crying, expressing my emotions, feeling deeply, are not traits you can make me feel bad for, sorry I’m in touch and in tune with myself and the world around me.
@ketaminal They really got my ass. I wasn’t ready
