brain is not happy :(
I don’t like that chemo brain literally just will stop me in my tracks and make me forget the past 25 minutes and then make me cry bc i get frustrated
@UnboundOCE @abortioncookies @darkmatteregg @biboofficial You’re going to have to chase happiness a little fucking harder being a Joshua that enjoys to mansplain things
@MooseinaBar @UnboundOCE @abortioncookies @darkmatteregg @biboofficial exactly, go in with some kind of idea. if you don’t, your service is slower and it takes a little longer to find out what’s wrong. thank you Danny
@UnboundOCE @abortioncookies @darkmatteregg @biboofficial Joshua, did I say I took upon my own gospel? Did I say I diagnosed myself then fucking did my own chemotherapy? Obviously fucking not, of course I got a second opinion. My point was usually if something is wrong with you (or a car, which this is about) you want to know before
@abortioncookies @darkmatteregg @biboofficial I self diagnosed my cancer... should I be thanking my doctor for even giving me treatment after that?  Poor argument dude, you’re just a sick mechanic if you kick people out for trying to figure out their shit
@SashaFood okay u win
@SashaFood I mean damn me too but she had 18 years of straight trauma without realizing it and then probably had to dissect that after
@SashaFood well now i just feel even worse for her and I’ve already seen the movie so many times I just never thought of that 🥲
@SashaFood but she has the “skip the drama, stay with momma” mindset and with gothel you think she ain’t got like some kind of mental illness
@SashaFood exactly i would be depressed af and not move in my tower
@SashaFood unless her brain is just actually happy but you know she isn’t cause she’s locked up 🥲
@SashaFood she’s so productive, no ones really that productive and creative without drugs
i want to be on whatever adderall rapunzel from tangled is on
@Ivan_bernal00 i checked and they’re all of her crying 😩 I want happy trisha
wait is this politics 😭😭
could be in my top 5
god why don’t more people like gnome and juliet
does anyone know where i can get a poster of trisha paytas
@marixxchill what about us? what about everything we’ve been thru? https://t.co/FCMopK3Ntq
how do i tell my dad to stop buying me so much juice I really can’t drink this much juice
@theonlymattybee do u need her to decapitate your head also or is that artist error

@LernMari @crystalcntr wait im sorry im barely seeing this 🥺 thank you so much wow
i love when people from denver that im not super close with get excited for me being home from the hospital lol 🥳 makes me smile
obviously im not fashionable but i dream of comfort clothing always
this is why ep summer will always sit right w me, wear the bare minimum and then once it’s end of july or you’re doing hood rat shi add a hoodie
part of growing up has to be learning how to dress for the weather and layering without too many layers
@SashaFood 🥺🥺
literally just a hug would make my life 5x better rn
no matter how much you love a person, if someone roasts you and they hate you and they are spot on or actually funny- i will laugh and i am sorry
@boujeedem sorry i just thought you hadn’t seen my snaps in awhile
i hate when i miss my friends but i refuse to call because i know they’re busy https://t.co/ZiLQCTfeN7
@TinyKittenFeet facts they live long enough to make sure they aren’t ugly
@TinyKittenFeet but like it has to be a hot vampire, I’d rather just get infected and kms my own way if they’re ugly
“lean, clean, drugged up machine” @LondonReams
@cholodolo3 @Abenation123 @Nancy_Carr @taaaaeee__ Not a reach, parking closer to buildings where you can be escorted to your car by a security officer will always be safer than having to walk 2-3 blocks to your car after a 6pm lecture
@Nelsonnathan99 @AdvocateTwo3 @CariKelemen The government isn’t trying to “destroy their people” they just want to capitalize on everything for their own selfish gain. Just out of curiosity have you read about the Civil War or The French Revolution by any chance? Check which side wins.
@Nelsonnathan99 @AdvocateTwo3 @CariKelemen Obviously the government lies-that’s always been a thing regardless. Stop calling the pandemic fake. Have you lived through a true pandemic like the 1918 flu or cholera? Unless you have or you have a PhD in Epidemiology and a concentration on Pandemics, your words are meaningless
@JusSayinThis @Nelsonnathan99 @AdvocateTwo3 @CariKelemen im saying this peacefully and patriotically, shut the hell up
@Nelsonnathan99 You guys all look like the same version of each other just birthed by different sets of cousins....
@Nelsonnathan99 @AdvocateTwo3 @CariKelemen As someone who is labeled as “most dangerous to” and “immunocompromised” I just FUCKING love being told all of this is just  a game we are playing pawns as. Nah dude this is my life and so many other peoples, so can you stop saying “we’re just playing a game” bc we aren’t.
@Nelsonnathan99 @AdvocateTwo3 @CariKelemen youre just someone that believes the world is out to get you and that 1% isn’t a significant number. Sure it’s not but once you remove 1% of people from communities because they don’t have the same immunity as “others do” you ignore their deaths, their stories and their illness
@hlb54 @CariKelemen There we go 👏🏼
@Nelsonnathan99 @CariKelemen Alright tell me the story, I’ve got cancer and I’ve got plenty of time in the hospital for you to tell me why you aren’t “playing along”
@hlb54 @CariKelemen I’m SO sorry you’re tired, but you should be proud of your state for not wanting more people in the hospital.
@CariKelemen @NotATrumpCard The mask mandate is the difference between showing your comnunity that you care or that you think you’re special enough to be above a disease.
@Stephmm18 get it 🤑🤑🤑 unless one of my sisters is there 😉
i hate men
i think it’s so selfish that when someone picks up food for you and you tell them exactly how to order it and they get it wrong, but their plate is fine and you just know that if something was wrong with theirs they would’ve had it remade
i don’t think of you anymore and i think that’s pretty cool
@boujeedem *all major movie production companies know is*
dang i really spelled please wrong
https://t.co/NdZP3MV30v   pleas help me by sharing or donating, any little bit helps and i truly am grateful for each and everyone that has helped out so far. https://t.co/m2xItyE485
i met someone with the name dot and i really can’t get over how cute it is
@the_tacofreak hot water is the best blanket
@SashaFood yeah i would total have to think you’re more superior than me ever
@theauguststar I know some Aries that deserve more than two pandemic birthday’s, evil hoes
@janixiyuh bitch I- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
i cry about twenty times a day and a lot of those tears really are just from me thinking how the hell did i deserve such good people in my life 😭❤️
all the nurses on my floor know i like asian cuisine so they keep asking me for recs ahhahaha   someone help me im running out of recs i haven’t left my home in months
@lilmissy182 at least let him help you a little or he’ll never want to again 🥲
cohesive at least https://t.co/uSkCYSL7ND https://t.co/SgBTiweqU6
@october23rdd @lilmissy182
the night nurse i have rn never wants to give me my nausea medication in time so whenever i throw up before she comes back idk why she’s so surprised
if i had a penny for every tear ive cried, you would catch me on Forbes 20 under 20
@lorettugh he’s a nice old man that wear disney ties everyday and it really does make me cry
my doctor always got me like 🥺 cause he will come in and be like “good morning precious” and whenever he leaves he always makes sure to say something like “you are so wonderful” 😭😭😭
@hacimrants she got her point across ☺️
