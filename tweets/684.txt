@CommanderReplay The difference between Oracle and tithe is that Oracle consult is a two card combo that requires stopping an etb effect or countering the spell all together. Smothering tithe is a 4 mana do nothing until someone draws a card. It’s strong but much easier to handle than Oracle IMO
@CommanderReplay If anyone leaves this card in play long enough for someone to win they need to reevaluate their deck building capabilities 😅😅😅 pay the tax or remove it, it’s simple

It’s interesting, so many people don’t know how to spell terrorists, it’s not spelled “protestors”. That’s so silly 😅😡
