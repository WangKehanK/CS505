@Damianknightt Dm me I’ll give you the deets!
@Damianknightt If you love in the LA area, try going to mystic canyon stables in palos Verdes for a trail ride on some horses. It’s outdoors, it’s open, and it’s fun! Friendly people too! :3
@SonicFox I know next to nothing about fighting games, train me sensei
@knnykin @DropDownBear @LenaTheFoxGirl I haven’t given up yet though, I think about Lena all the damn time. I just hope she’s okay...
@knnykin @DropDownBear @LenaTheFoxGirl It turns 18 in June. Then I can legally house it, and it wouldn’t be forced back to abuse. Other then that..it’s just a waiting game right now. I have lenas address so I was wondering if I could send it something nice to let it know we’re still here but idk if that’s be too sus..
@knnykin @DropDownBear @LenaTheFoxGirl As far I know, Lena was caught and sent back home. No communication at all since November. The most we know is it went to a physch ward soon after (maybe it attempted? I’m really not sure) and so far they’ve been stuck with their abuser. All our hands are tied until-
@HarryButAverage Harry gets it 😝
@lmaowhat536 @spookcy @bunnydelphine She looks like a 50’s Jane doe. That’s the issue
@bunnydelphine It was t your face (I was kinda but not really) it was the fact you looked like a 50’s Jane doe.
@bunnydelphine Sorry girl but the way you dressed you looked like an 8 year old girl. That’s what the issue was. Your right about power play cuz I love it too BUT acting like a raped child isn’t aight you know?
@PIBBLEKING Hey I don’t mean to be THAT person but, pls put a trigger warning before hand. This kind of shit puts me into a panic attack and I’m sure other people feel the same
@IuveIetter @chikenwiener @softblackgirls Vibe
@DjAllGooD30 @44horrormovies @Asensii20 @JoeBiden We call it a conspiracy theory because it doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. We’re not “scared” we just think you sound stupid
@HarryButAverage It’ll be okay man! Things always get better :3 ❤️

@ayanami000000 @robbiedamico64 @jimbo_peck @Sanjigoat Damn this girl woke up and chose violence, she came out swinging for no reason LOL
@HarryButAverage Harry you play eso?
@Ms_Kursha @_D_F_W @KENDALLDOTKOM Lol y’all read my tone wrong, I’m just being goofy not aggro XD
@thylastmourning @Ms_Kursha @KENDALLDOTKOM Damn y’all read my tone really wrong, I ain’t here being aggressive I’m being eccentric and loud. I ain’t trying to insult no one 😂😂
@Ms_Kursha @KENDALLDOTKOM Also y’all, a reminder that there was a tinker bell Intro for the theaters where she tapped the screen and it went all sparkling
@n3di0 @Ms_Kursha @KENDALLDOTKOM I’m p sure Mandela effects are just multiple similar memories mashed together. I remember this, and this combined with the other one could make someone believe that it was a specific way. For me she didn’t dot the i, she made the whole screen turn sparkling on the logo
@thylastmourning @Ms_Kursha @KENDALLDOTKOM “D I S N E Y S  F A S T P L A Y  W I L L B E G I N  I N  A  M O M E N T” ✨🌟✨✨🌟✨✨🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️

@ramahuro I have a skull replica of him https://t.co/0FV69cCHEA
@hecallmeslater @Miamore5623 @KENDALLDOTKOM Lemme see that evidence 👀
@hecallmeslater @Miamore5623 @KENDALLDOTKOM There’s no way, when he was swinging on branches he was using his arms. And also I vividly remember. Him when it’s a shot of him from behind and he’s looking up
@Miamore5623 @hecallmeslater @KENDALLDOTKOM I NEVER remember him having a tail

@confusedandokay Dude i was wondering “how tf I follow a fetishizing white guy??”
@justIIikemagic Moana came out 4 years ago
@galliumcore @halo_promise The point is, the dev has not caused any trouble whatsoever and keeps promises for the game and updates it in a nice consistent fashion. They are making ACTUAL progress
@galliumcore @halo_promise I understand your wariness however,I’m in the discord and there have been 0 problems with the devs esp head dev and they are all very professional.However,it seem to me that dondi did/is now doing the things he accused head dev of. I don’t kno everythin bout the sit., but don sus
@halo_promise I 100% play this game I am Iccigato on there
@Pup1k1 like at least leave a yelp review behind XD
@Prongiix @prickIypaws I love the arizona/utah desert vibe, its the same vibe I try to give my sona!! https://t.co/uIxFF4fIqI
@Prongiix @prickIypaws Is that character a pronghorn antelope?
@Pup1k1 This pisses me off beyond belief
@Pup1k1 When the anger calms down, maybe pointing out the artist then? I don’t want to commission this person on accident and they should be held accountable for their actions

@DojaCat I’ll give you $50 if you take me on ur world tour
@moosemead https://t.co/vz2DjTU89N
@KGilles34512959 @icanhazaspergrs @emmabell42 Damn and these comments show your oversensitivity. Like I said, no one who isn’t a Karen gets called Karen. It’s not random, people who act like crazy entitled bratty adults are Karens, Karen’s a term, not a damn slur. Only Karen’s get worried about being called Karen
@KGilles34512959 @icanhazaspergrs @emmabell42 No offense but only Karen’s get called Karen. Be a good human being and you don’t have to worry about it. People don’t randomly call people Karen, it’s always for a reason.
I actually love all of this https://t.co/TSj8FoMIZK https://t.co/uz8It9IyBS
@HarryButAverage Was alright!

@cabbagebobobo @StardustWeirdo @PinkPantherRule A gen z who acts like a boomer
@Horsefur1 Time to move to Utah, state of the kitty
@HarryButAverage I think about that sometimes too, my guess is if your relationship is shit you probably couldn’t survive the aftermath but if y’all love each other and communicate well you’ll prob just wait a little longer
@sharloola Fucked up pirate shenanigans
@cathode_g Uhhh it’s just a coyote? And a friendly one at that? Why people being so mean
@HarryButAverage HARRY DAMN
@Horsefur1 I like ur name it matches mine. Furry feline Riley’s
@RockkSergal Like sergals aren’t really my thing, I don’t like them as a species much, but I’ve never been biased against them for any sort of subculture they carry.
@RockkSergal Have we actually gotten to the point of furry speciesism/racism
@freckle_red @disclosetv Damn bruh I’m just saying it’ll be easier to pressure him for change then trump. THATS something to celebrate. Life will get easier
@disclosetv To be honest tho,electing Biden has made for a less steep uphill battle for justice.He’s not perfect but it’ll be easier to pressure the gov to do something,so it’s not something we shouldn’t celebrate ya know? It’s okay to feel happy and like things will be easier,cuz it will
Rainbow on Hollywood BLVD, even god is celebrating Biden’s win!! https://t.co/tpSGpPlEZg
@FIREW0LF500 Toffee fudge
@iLikeyecutG @OOCWesternR34 Does she fall in love and have sex with him? But not raunchy sex like, loving and romantic type?

@JoeBiden Someone report all these fucking bots they’re annoying and I’m TIRED
