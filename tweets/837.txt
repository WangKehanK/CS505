The sheer amount of people hating on ADTRs new album is ridiculous. Like yeah, they aren’t making homesick pt2, it’s been like 12 years.
More things, also my wall painting skills are ✨phenomenal✨ https://t.co/HID1P2fVKa
@chel_island Honestly, it’s a vibe
Lol so I’m moving and we are helping renovate and we decided to do an orange accent wall but it’s like Kraft Mac and cheese. My boyfriend is going to lose it tomorrow https://t.co/huSqU9ao9Z
Lmao my dad thinks I use the Disney+ acct but in reality it’s my boyfriends parents because I signed in on their tv once
I had to put my cat down today, my poor child🥺 I hope she’s having fun with our other fur babies in the great beyond https://t.co/kQKfKGO1yT
@ThatsSoo_Ravin You should check to see if your computer stores save files separately. Mine does so just removing the application does nothing :c
My dog had surgery and the cone of shame is hilarious https://t.co/Slt1jzu1dR
@ypitaxo Yeah I think so, my mom was a single mom because she gave my bio dad the option to walk away when she decided to keep me. He did and ya know it was nice growing up, got a great step dad and half sister, it worked out.
Teaching has taught me so much patience. I teach second grade all day, then in the afternoon I teach high schoolers cheerleading, and then in the evening I teach my sister all 5 subjects she's not naturally good at. I'm dead
This is the vibe today https://t.co/KGdtxHEVAZ
@KDEVIL33 Idk, it’s really weird, especially when they all match. Like my family just holds our dog in front the tree and text people that picture.
@davidmackau I’m a cheerleading coach and we would usually do a Christmas scavenger hunt at the mall and every year one of the things is to video themselves singing a Christmas carol to random people in the mall. It’s hilarious
I met my current bf at my old job and one of my favorite memories together was when we were just friends and went to Santa Cruz and decided to call out of work and chill there all day lmao
@jinkiesjessie @Bee_Trxpp We don’t know each other but if you ever need somebody to chat with or vent to my DMs are open❤️✨
@tkbone32221 @nytimes I think you missed a key word here. “decriminalization” doesn’t equal “legalization”. Decriminalizing the plant will simply lead to less clogged prisons and more opportunities for those previously charged with possession
@losey13 Fr, I hit that new album a little too hard apparently 🥸
Lmao I can’t even post my Spotify wrapped because I spent Jan-may listening to bassnectar 🙃
@TessaPaisa It’s to make the day drinking more reasonable. But i also think 2 is too early. Like 4-5 sure.
@williamlegate The BoR and first amendment protect you and give you freedoms from the government, not privately owned apps and companies.
@FullSend_Raver Idk if y’all have heard of Parler or have been on that social site, but these threats are scary and 10x worse on that right wing platform. Stay safe yall &lt;3
I'm a first grade teacher now and I made my first worksheet, its so cute✨ https://t.co/q17xOkHmPE
He left us when we needed him most, RIP Mac Miller https://t.co/S84FuVeRvV
How are people buying festival tickets when we have no idea when COVID is gonna let up
Y’all ever try to take pics with dogs?? https://t.co/75B5tKxldo
I work and live in the Silicon Valley and I be seein the craziest of people around here. Like one time I met shemar Moore at P.F. Chang’s, shits wild
@Floridaliberty1 @nytimes So, what about capital punishment? Or the immigrants going “missing” in deportation centers? Or the threats on public healthcare that would inevitably kill thousands of Americans? I’m not saying abortion is right but gov. sanctioned death is very prevalent in this country
So I teach first graders and they’re literally so funny. They think I’m 16 and just a big kid learning how to be a teacher. I mean yes this is accurate but I’m just a lil older 😅
@74frz The energy in this photo is immaculate✨ you’re so pretty!
Damn, that eighth grader’s question was spitting more bars than this whole debate
Covid would laugh at the amount of times I’ve split a wine bag with approximately 30 strangers and all of us were drinking it from the nipple.
We gotta protect Claudia Conway, she’s so funny I just watched all her tik toks. I’d die if my parents were in the public eye like that. She’s fr 15 leave her alone 😂
Living in the Bay Area is pretty nice ☀️ https://t.co/oNgHZBUCSX
@skywalk_her Cookie Monsts the DJ passed away 😥😥
What a tragic loss in the bass music community today, Cookie Monsta is one of my top listens, his unique sound caught my eye back in 2017 and I will be forever thankful that I got to see his sets and be a part of his community 😥
@Britt_Sapphire Dude same wtf😥😥😥
I turned 23 today and so now I’m officially ✨old af✨ https://t.co/axJfw98wgV
@skywalk_her https://t.co/OgO1NogRTB
@vibrvntcourt I’ve def seen fights similar to this outside of the la Vics by SJSU at 1am omg, wild
@tammmss @ThorniestBerry Yeah, this is deep set racism where white ppl believe that cultural training is offensive because it calls out the wrong doings of white ppl past. I’m pretty liberal socially &amp; I remember a time when it hurt me when I’d hear white ppl did x&amp;y but I was 15 and didnt understand
Idk about y’all but I went to the protests in Oakland and they were peaceful. Trump says Oakland because in his mind it = black population and that’s fucked up. We need to eliminate the racist idea the black=violence. Black=human, culture, beauty, the future past&amp; present of USA
I bought my first piece on lingerie and I feel like a bad bitch
@arkangelnoise Good point, the both of them have some serious control because I would thrown hands
Also the more I pay attention to Biden, I don’t think he has dementia but possibly dyslexia? Some of the words he stumbles on are the same ones my dyslexic boyfriend does because ✨letters✨
@chel_island Ugh cheese corn 😩😩😩
I chose to do a drinking game with friends for the debate tonight, I’m drunk and angry😡 especially as a Californian with a criminal justice and political science education
@adriennerubens Idk where y’all go to school but I read most of these for my high school English courses. (Bay Area, CA)
To anybody that may see this, my cheer team is hosting a fundraiser! Rn this may be the only way we can fundraise due to COVID and its super important for our lower income athletes. https://t.co/SUhlvGNQZF
I love these stupid butterfly filters 🥺✨ https://t.co/hwCi7WxcWX
I should be day drinking with the homies in legend valley rn 😖 there’s nobody to slap wine bags with in corona land😡
Libra szn✨✨ #ColoursOfTheZodiac https://t.co/Oescce8wHp https://t.co/iU8fen1mcK
Plz make sure y’all are educating yourselves on what’s going to be in your ballot next month. It takes like a hour to read through all 12 props in CA and maybe 2 hours to investigate electable officials
My family has slowly been making the switch and electric is the way to go. I love my hybrid but once electric cars are more affordable I’ll be making that dive. https://t.co/NnUwUsrUnI
I shoulda been on an airplane with my bros going to Ohio tomorrow. 😥💔🦕
I love libra szn. I feel so powerful
The world without Justice Ginsburg cannot be real. Such a strong woman, she fought for us every day of her life. What a legend 😥
@chel_island U can
I wish I was throwin ass at lost lands for my bday like I do every year 🥺😰 it’s okay tho, I’m gonna get trashed and eat sushi instead
Normalize being polite with your exes, nod n keep walking, keep the toxic energies in the past https://t.co/VCMm13y3ee
@bassbitchxo October 1st✨🍂🎃
@206starboy High af, my insurance is $100. But I also call and complain everytime they try and raise my premium. It’s up for debate again in two weeks, can’t wait to hit their line for low premiums. Also I use Esurance in CA for reference
@_kendallmm This is what I had for breakfast today too 🥺🥑🍳
Two years ago today I was at lost lands with my friends 😰 I miss lost lands and I miss my friends https://t.co/1nLwaUGOpp
Please watch the movie if you haven’t because this is a major problem that is often hiding in the shadows where the public can’t see.
Nobody ever talked to me about it! Nobody teaches little girls to not put themselves out there and half the time it happens behind closed doors where parents don’t see because we know that what we are doing is scandalous and taboo because we are little babies to mom and dad.
The dance competition in the movie is run by adults that didn’t pull the plug on juveniles dancing like 25 year olds in a rap video. When I was 13, I had a stream that would get hundreds of viewers that were 90% pedophiles but I was a child and I as no clue and
On top of that, it exposes the market that exists for this content. These children have no idea what they’re doing, I didn’t know what I was doing, but you do it because you feel like you can be grown up. The disgusting side is that the market is there,
The over sexualization of women and the need tween girls feel to be wanted and desired is absolutely disgusting and the film does an excellent job of showing what goes into the mental process of being that age and wanting to be seen as more than a little girl.
I imagine that millions of little girls are exposing themselves to situations highlighted in the film. I say this because I was thirteen and skimming chat rooms and streaming online to be “hot” and “sexy” for an audience that I had no business being involved with.
So I watched Cuties today, and I understand the controversy behind the film,but as a woman that first hand experienced what these girls did when I was a tween I think it’s really important for people to watch it and see the bigger picture.
@chel_island I buy myself a salmon lovers roll for lunch like every other day. I have a sushi addiction but it’s mostly to give myself a lil treat for sticking to my calories
@chel_island Because kindness travels further than revenge/pain/etc✨ but also I’ll whoop some ass 4 u
Lol everything hurts
I’ve been rewatching greys anatomy and Sandra Oh is such a great actress, i look at her face and it’s like instant tears, I’m crying 😅
This is an informational packet, my dead mother also received one. But I know she won’t get a mail in ballot because she didn’t in 2018, 2016, or 2014. Informational packets follow a different list than voter registration, we should probs get her off that list lol https://t.co/DSdNDyFG3V
@lilmisslyss5 Fr, I’m pretty sure we both got CJ degrees too. I’m getting interviews to be a ✨nanny✨
