@RaceTrac there was a transaction on my card made at 9am and I was at home and didn’t make it and I messaged cash app about it but I was told to message you guys about getting a refund. https://t.co/qCFvKwhEHP

@AamerAnwar I live here. Happened 6 years ago. People still remember it but it’s been taken care of.
@JBrooks_89 There’s this couple that comes in all the time &amp; another one of my regulars was behind them in line &amp; was like “y’all are so funny,are y’all brother &amp; sister?” &amp; I stood there👀,knowing they’re not, &amp; they laughed &amp; she said “no that’s my boyfriend but he acts like a kid” 🤣🤣
I got so lucky the other day!! Monday is 99¢ day at goodwill for whatever the color is (blue this time) and I found this 6 year old @HoodieAllen signed shirt so I bought it. It’s a medium and I can’t wear it but it’s something since I’ve still never been to one of his concerts 💖 https://t.co/cUucrXCFWU
@jordyxbee There’s one in my hometown buried at our trains depot place and I’m hoping I’ll still be alive to watch it get dug up. I think it was buried before I was even born maybe. I can find pics of it
@Tinder Me 🥺
@SymonB6 @naiyasierra Wait someone on my snap just was promoting him. It was a guy but still. I even SS it to go check him out. Yikes
@texasroadhouse The dockside favorites section aint workin when I try to order online 🥺
@jordyxbee WAIT ARE WE TWINS BC I UPDATED IT ON MY PHONE and I haven’t played since Valentine’s Day and I thought the same thing and I died and got 75th place AND I DID THIS YESTERDAY TOO
@shanedawson I work @ a Dollar General. We gotta wipe down our counter,pin pad, bag thingy every 3 customers, germx after every person , wash out hands at every hour no matter what. It’s crazy but just tryna help keep it sanitized.

@93feetofsmoke @ me next time 😂😂😂
Was tryna hold all my stuff and food coming back into the hospital and I accidentally grabbed my @CookOut drink too hard and stabbed a hole through the bottom of my cheerwine 🥺 I cried 😩😢 didn’t even get to drink it I was sad
@NaomiNorelli @pulte Try your nearest dollar generals!! They always need help 🙏🏻
@lucikeIIy Use seat geek and use @DavidDobrik code and it’ll basically cover the purchase fee that’s like $20/$25
@CookOut @DrinkCheerwine #CookOutCheermas cheerwine and orange Fanta mixed and with a corndog  🤤🤤🤤
@CookOut That would be so awesome 🥺💕😩
@nerdjpg If concert videos count , post Malone. If not, Steve Harvey. Obv which one id choose
@oceansoriginals 86
Do they have Chick-fil-A outside of America ????? Like do you British people know what that is? Or like Russians or Chinese know what cfa is? I feel stupid asking
@jordyxbee Yo I still have yours hanging up from 2/3 years ago. I appreciate your art so much ❤️❤️
