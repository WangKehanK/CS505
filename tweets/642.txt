My lil thesis on Pink Diamond. #pink #pinkdiamond #StevenUniverse #stevenuniversefuture #su
Everything she did was to better herself regardless of how it affected others and yes that could be bad but there’s a respect I have for her for literally going and creating her own perfect life and creation despite what was expected of her and her importance in the galaxy.
often while I was growing up and yes you wanna be a good person and help others but that loneliness starts to make you feel bitter and angry at others for not seeing that or even caring to try and feel what you’re feeling. She became incredibly selfish as a result.
I like Pink bc I understand where she was coming from. Yes, she had a responsibility to so many people but her entire existence she just wanted to be happy w her family. They didn’t feel the same and left her to the side forgetting about her more often than not. I was alone too
