"I‚Äôve wept over the 13-year-old girl who was me, the only Asian girl in her class, who wished nothing more than to look like the blonde and blue-eyed girls ..."  So many of us remember wanting nothing more than to be white as a child. So proud of @KamiRieck for this piece: https://t.co/TyKhJX72Yo
üëÄ thank you @propublica!! super excited to attend IRE &amp; ONA this year :') https://t.co/hyxr28JLXb
Good to examine this phenomenon in general, but nothing in the article explains how this could've led a man to kill eight people. All it does is imply homicidal violence is supposed to be a normal response to the "sexual anguish" imposed by religion?  https://t.co/yO0GFQj8DF
‚¨áÔ∏è Simply hiring BIPOC doesn't further diversity if they don't feel supported in the workplace. That's just another way to push them out. https://t.co/2cq6n0Hfph
@ramtinarablouei Thank you!! I'm so glad you're still in this industry. Also because I LOVE Throughline :D
Lastly, this was cut from the story, but I felt it's a valuable perspective. A wise mentor once told me to put deleted info on social media when promoting your story if you still want it seen: https://t.co/YZ4dmcp6Lx
During wars in the Philippines, Korea and Vietnam, U.S. soldiers regularly solicited sex workers in Asia. The association of Asian women with sex work followed these men home and continued to show up in Hollywood ‚Äî contributing to the fetishization of these women.
The Chinese Exclusion Act, signed into law in 1882, shut Chinese laborers out of the U.S. for more than half a century. Until the 2017 Muslim Ban, it was the only law in U.S. history to ban a specific group from entering the country.
Asians have been treated as aliens in the U.S. for at least 150 years. The first federal law to restrict immigration, the Page Act of 1875, effectively prohibited Chinese women from entering the U.S. It was justified by the assumption that they'd be brought in for prostitution.
The longer-term solution to improving safety is stability, community organizers say. Many Boston neighborhoods with high Asian American populations, like Chinatown and Dorchester, are also increasingly gentrified. A better way to help is to create jobs and affordable housing.
Victims of violence in immigrant communities are already less likely to contact police. They become even more reluctant if they cannot speak English and cannot communicate with officers in their native language.
Asian communities can have large populations of undocumented immigrants, and some local law enforcement agencies work with ICE ‚Äî which deported 33 refugees to Vietnam this week. Many of the women who work at massage parlors are undocumented.
Community leaders in Boston say they fear the response to rising hate crimes will be to deploy more police in affected communities, which may do more harm than good.  My latest: https://t.co/gytsSbq8lq
@lexwvr @irvindzhang Why is it tinted green too üò≠
This was the first AAJA meeting I've ever attended and I def didn't expect to cry in front of a bunch of journos I've never met but the support &amp; love everyone gave made me realize immediately why this group feels like family. I'm so in love with @aaja and its members https://t.co/fkMAGsRhXV
Esp considering journalists are taught to be so skeptical about what gov't officials and other figures of authority say, I never understood why newspapers just report police statements at face value. Oftentimes with no other sources. https://t.co/d0vHm9msAy
To my Asian-American community in Boston, I'd love to share your stories, your emotions, your opinions. If you're comfortable, @GBHNews hopes to center your voices in an article. My DMs are open.
And honestly, how can anti-Asian racism be un-American when Asian-Americans (born &amp; raised here for generations now) are constantly TOLD we're not American?  "Did you just come over to the U.S.?" "Where are you from? No, like where are you *from*?" "Your English is so good!" https://t.co/tf2TnuPKvH

@omarsrashad Literally slept from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. two nights ago
Seeing us on TV was pretty cool too (Kami's in Indiana, unfortunately): https://t.co/alCgJyLsiO
Our data analysis showed the SBA is unable to track demographics of first-round PPP borrowers ‚Äî making it nearly impossible to determine how much of the money went to minority-owned businesses in Boston. https://t.co/khZ04ESgc4
All newsrooms should be investing heavily in audience engagement if they're not already ‚Äî this includes improving the accessibility of their content! So much important info is missed out on by the public when outlets don't take advantage of audience strategies. https://t.co/mpRgcIQQ1m
@dailyfreepress Glad to see it!! Rest up &lt;3
@radioanngal @Poynter I appreciate that!!
The journalism industry is rife with barriers to entry from the start. I come from a family that lives below the U.S. poverty line and know firsthand how inaccessible the field can be. So, I wrote about it for @Poynter. https://t.co/XZkULNcAdP
mfs be like "feb." bc they no longer know how to write w/o using ap style üò≠ https://t.co/eA9xAeuvN1
same energy as when ppl question why unhoused ppl have cell phones, cars, nice clothes, etc. https://t.co/J6bAxbBjsK
As a first gen student, I'm uncomfortable with the elitist mindset that super formal email greetings somehow signal more "respectful" intent. If anything, "Hi Prof. X" is more genuine ‚Äî and just as respectful as anything else. I never use "Dear" and won't unless asked to. https://t.co/Plv75ycI1v
