@glitzdee Especially after I get like 0.1 drinks in me. I’m just like fuck it give me the wings and fries lol.
Anyone: “you hungry?”  Me, who just ate: “I could eat”
A word of advice for people straight out of school. Grown ass people who own companies will try to fineness you because you are new to life and don’t know how to manage your money. 9/10 you will fall into their trap at a young age. That includes debt. Don’t buy shit on credit!!
Y’all want to normalize everything and turn everything into a joke. Shit doesn’t sit right.
You can’t take a shot because it’s “nasty.”  I just ordered Canes and ate the coleslaw first.

@drakesfavee Not if you don’t know. I’d say open a Roth IRA account though Morgan Stanley. Especially if you’re looking for long-term investments or retirement.
@_Mr_Capricorn This dude goes hard idc lol
The guy who took my order at Canes just told me to have a beautiful, amazing wonderful day! Now I feel like I can do anything. Chick-fil-a you better step your game up.
I miss Athena
In 6 years I went from having $0.13 in the bank with my first child on the way and riding my bike to work to make $10.25 a hour.   Now owning 2 cars and a house browsing for 100k cars and having the means to make that browsing a reality if I want.   Life changes fast have faith.
@TheBeezMeez Do you know anywhere that does appraisals?
I need someone who’s on the Pokémon card game to appraise my cards. I want to sell them but I don’t know where or for how much.
@muhryssarae I like StockX for kicks but Goat for other clothing items.
At this point I bet if Travis Scott started wearing Spizikes y’all would make them $1,000😂
Man I really needed that $5,600 stimmy.
My real friends didn’t forget about me or “think I was too busy” once I had kids. And that says a lot.
Franklin got to much dip on his chip now.
Like if I was a robber I know for a fact I’d be taking all the stuff I secretly want but always walk past at the store like “damn he has a Rubik’s cube and stress ball” !
I always get nervous buying shit like this. Like I’m going to be the one guy who get his house broken into by a robber who JUST SO HAPPEN to need a recipe book for his dinner tonight. https://t.co/AewmwMVl6a
Best part of working Sundays is Sunday night slow jams.
Work is fucking stressful
until we are at that point in our life taking our last breath.   This comes to my mind often and I know it’s pretty personal but I just thought I’d share that with y’all.
I was talking to her while holding her hand and the last thing she said to me was “Nolan, pray for me”. It gave me the chills as I knew she was always a non-believer in God. I tell myself God touched her heart that night and maybe she had some understanding a lot of us don’t have
Without crying and honestly a look of peace and relief on her face as she made that decision. The power and strength of that still amazes me and I sometimes think if I’d have that same courage when my time comes.
Anyways, the last seconds of her life right up to the moment she took her last breath she was 100% aware of what was going on and she held a conversation with me just as you and I would. She made the conscious decision to pull the plug on herself in the hospital.
Last September I lost my aunt who played a major roll in getting me my carrier.   She struggles her whole life with health issues and was a non-believer in God (or so I thought). Actually, she was just really angry at God for the way her life played out.   A thread....
@_Mr_Capricorn I bet you sending out hella “you up” texts right now 😂
I’m buying one more scratcher and this shit better hit because I ain’t fucking leaving vacation!!! I ain’t fucking leaving!!
@_Mr_Capricorn Shut yo ass up lol
Last day of vacation and I’m hurt. I wish life could stay like this 😫
Why do they have to start the season with Franklin acting like Jesse Pinkman.
@pterrod7 Damn, I was about to make this in SF too..
I miss my dog man. Shit ain’t right
It’s strange how we can love someone/ something that never speaks a single word to us. They just show us how much they love us every single day, without  question &amp; without judgment. Its not about what you say it’s about what you do. I wish I was more of an animal in that aspect.
We really don’t deserve dogs.   R.I.P beautiful puppy. You silently helped me though some of the hardest times of my life. I swear sometimes you could read my mind and just know to comfort me. You really were amazing. I love you and I’ll miss you. https://t.co/wuePsqmdfS
Athena 🐶♥️ love you girl.  I’m sorry you had to go out like that.
I’m kicking myself ifor this damn AMC and BB thing rn😓
I still don’t give a foook!!!
Yo wtf
First day of vacation and I can’t stress this enough FUHGKKKK THAT PLACE! Hopefully I hit this damn lotto I ain’t going back!
@trapmastah Morton’s * but out of those 2 Ruth Chris
Fuck statism
God knows how much I need this vacation
Haven’t even left for work yet and I’ll already want to come home.
Idk why some of the smartest people I know try so hard to act dumb.
@Briellemomma I really been putting everyone on that show! It’s super good!   Look up why the second season is 20 episodes unlike the rest of the seasons. It’s pretty crazy.
Then you make it and you’re like “hell yeah I beat my record” lol
Do y’all ever like race yourself home from work? Like “I bet I can make it there before 10:37” and really be stressed if you are close to not making it.
When you eat XXTRA Flaming hot Cheetos do y’all just power through it or eat ice?
Y’all ever just be like..   IM NOT IN THE FUCKING MOOD RIGHT NOW!
My niece @_lillywells  sent me this and damn. Digging deep in the memories with this one. Anyone else do this? https://t.co/6ECvRAlS67
Y’all really killed SB’s and 1’s. Can’t even buy a basic ass pair anymore without getting boned.
I just wrote a 15 page report that took me 6 days for my supervisor to call it “a lazy investigation”  I’m over working for other people man that’s for sure.
Take me back to the days where when people saw me after not seeing me in a while they’d say “wow you’re getting so big” but they meant taller.😭
Nah Trippie is dope. https://t.co/Y7jxmf25od
YO!! GTA San Andreas is releasing remastered and extended for the PS5. I’m literally about to go back to being 12 again dude😭
This job is wack because I don’t get to be with Family on these day but hey God is good, happy new year to everyone! Be safe be smart(:
Happy birthday dude!!! We miss you out here in the IE. @_Mr_Capricorn https://t.co/OjHfCbCc8t
Everyone hyping up the PS5? Bitch, I can’t even turn this shit on.  Take me back to midnight club DUB addition please.
It feels like 2am
And just like that.. I am intoxicated on Christmas again. ✌🏼 Merry Chrysler
I was on offer up trying to get this damn PS5 and I came across someone selling it who also has a shoe bussiness. I offered to trade him for my new castles and he said no because it seems sketchy that I’d want to trade them for a PS5😂 I can’t win.
@Ivannthegreatt You ready? https://t.co/Z10L6Jl0zR https://t.co/4oB9DqaiPq
My soul would literally leave my body no joke. https://t.co/IaBpIOTOo9
I just watched this video and it said. There was a last time you played outside with all your friends as a kid and you didn’t even know it.
@_Mr_Capricorn 😭🤣

@pterrod7 Icon board shop  Mervyn’s
Just taking it day by day right now
Went skating today with the homies and could barely land a heel flip.   It felt good being exhausted though!
@_Mr_Capricorn Why you always do me like that when I’m just over here minding my bussiness enjoying my day.
Just waisted most of my day off sleeping. Now I’m up by myself just laying in bed. I fucking hate graveyards.
Nicole dropped her phone and cracked it. Then when she got home she dropped the leftover thanksgiving food THEN right after picked up Liam and he spit up on her.  Life isn’t fair sometimes 😂
