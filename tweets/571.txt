These rant are from a youtube video of haunted maine i just saw, time and temp building in Portland, built in 1910, ohhhh the elevator does weird stuff....go figure...
I work in empty old buildings late at night,being creeped out fine but if you actually SEE and HEAR things that LEGIT cant be explained, ya a nut,get pills.  One of my jobs the elevator just does random shit and lights go out, its called bad electrics...
When I lived in Windham there was a"haunted"cemetery I went to,apparently another"haunted"cemetery was down the road, and my house was acrossed the street from a godamn mortuary,when I was in the ever famous mount hope cemetery it was so my dog could shit, saw nothing then either
A word on "hauntings" I've been to some of the most "haunted" places in Maine, usually not knowing they were "haunted" til after I left and people told me, I've never seen anything, and I do alot of mushrooms....Ghosts aren't real, grow the fuck up...

@Zelda_Kasahara well try staying at home for once, lol.
Actually here's a high brow story, the first time i got "busted" for being high as a kid/teen, I walked into the kitchen and my mother took one look at me, and cracked the fuk up and between laughs she said like "you're fucking high" so, yeah, it wasnt too frowned upon...
...maybe it's the mushrooms
If you recall your first time smoking pot you may or may not remember(depending on age) it was awesome, followed by wicked anxiety, from "wow I feel weird" to "I know they know I'm high"  Ironically in my "old age" I can do mushrooms all day yet NOW pot makes me feel super weird
I recently read an article that said marijuana gets alcohol into your blood faster, and I was like nawww, though I was a wicked pothead a barely smoke now, so I smoked alot tonight for the first time in forever, and you know what, there might be something to that.
@UberFacts That's so fucking depressing...
