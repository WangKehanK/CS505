I love my boyfriend he paying for my nails and feet randomly coming home with surprises and gifts I’m not used to this treatment at all.
At work on FaceTime with my boyfriend listening to him help my son clean his room...cutest thing ever 🥰

I wish you could dislike tweets
Ever have those friends that say what they want with no filter but as soon as you do it they’re offended 🙄
My boyfriend got rushed into a emergency procedure and my anxiety is real messed up
Yup I don’t like her
I love when my boyfriend pick me up from work I seriously hate driving now
It’s the support I’m getting from my work friends for me.
Somehow he’ll always get the glory
