Idk if I’m hearing my dog cry or I think im hearing her cry. 🙃🙃
This morning has to be the worst one yet
If anyone has tips for puppies send them my way 🤗🐶
I love my little Luna though 🐶💛
Having a puppy is fun but work too I forgot what it was to have one. 😅
Woke up to an unplugged charger 🙃
@NeverFamousLiz I’m jealous! Tell me how it goes
Can it be next week I want to get paid already. ☹️
I bought a basketball and I’m excited to start playing again 😫
Some people be doing the most
I haven’t been feeling myself
Having a pool with a filter I feel is work
And I can feel a migraine coming ☹️
I’ve been feeling exhausted ☹️
