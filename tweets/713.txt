Let’s normalize not being your own boss. You don’t have to own your own business to be successful. Owning a business isn’t for everyone, shits stressful af. It’s okay to work a 9-5.
PSA you can watch aquamarine on YouTube for free!!

@cufrink Do it
@cufrink I read this post not too long ago that talked about this girl never wearing things she enjoyed because she was waiting for the “right moment” &amp; that she now wears whatever she wants, whenever because it doesn’t matter what it’s for if it makes you feel good!!
Pizza rolls? Unmatched.
This was SUPPOSED to say “I’m so drunk I’m spinning, fuck” and shortly after I tweeted this, I fell asleep on the couch.
I’m so drunk I’m sounnging fuvk

My dog is very smart, but she does lack in obedience sometimes. As a responsible dog owner I am making it my responsibility to train her out of her bad habits. Because of her past with her previous owner she has leash aggression around other dogs, but I am DETERMINED to end that
I just bleached my place so hard I cant fucking breathe!!!
I just had digiorno pizza for the first time in my life &amp; im just confused as to how these commercials hyped it up so much. Y’all are right though it is NOT close to delivery at all. 🥴
Irreplaceable by Beyoncé is 1000% responsible for the way my confidence was built.
I know Girl Scout cookies didn’t just delete thanks a lots like that... how fucking dare you.
Who knew having a place of your own brings you so much damn peace
Also I’m addicted to the dumb ass egg bites that I know I could make myself
Wow people are so kind. I was kinda having a shitty start to my day because my first client of the day cancelled like 10 mins before her appt. I went to Starbucks to cure my sadness &amp; the person in front of me paid for my order 🥲

@TylerLindlau I need them to be a thing

@branflakes_96 @cufrink Aw you two are so sweet 🥲
@cufrink @branflakes_96 The uniform there was super comfy too even though they size you down on everything. My ass cheeks were OUT let me tell you!! Lol
@cufrink @branflakes_96 So after I quit RL I interviewed at hooters &amp; got the job and got sized for the uniform but then didn’t end up working there and i still have the pics on my phone for the simple fact that I looked cute https://t.co/0pihqR8Gjw
@LindseyRomanoo Forever &amp; always bitch 💖
@FickesCarli before I watched that show someone had told me I reminded them of Serena, so as I was watching it I was so offended that someone perceived me in that way or thought I even acted remotely close to her behavior 🤢
@FickesCarli Georgina too
@briannasanti_ Oh man 😂😂 are you at your parents thing?
Jov was sound asleep, stood up, I’m like ???? You good? He says “yes, I’m driving” and lays back down. Alllllrighty 😂

Currently dressed for the season we’re in, but that we don’t have. So I’ll definitely be sweating by noon
All I wanna know is why tf my body decided that 7:30 was a good time to wake up on my day off.
Wow. I’ve officially gotten to the point in my career that I cant accept new clients because I’m booked out. Blessed, grateful, shocked.
