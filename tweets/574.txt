@CJMiles_99 I have no idea what this means because Iâ€™m 5 hours in, but great!
@ThePersonCarlos Playing it right is the part that stresses me out, but thanks!
I really enjoy turn based style games so I like this combat a lot, Iâ€™m hoping I have time to grind though, I like a laid back experience
Ok... I might have to buy it to play Radiant Garden. That was my biggest disappointment with KH3 hands down https://t.co/eKYcKEJJ8T
@DrButtersnaps These people have brain worms
Ghost/fire !!!! https://t.co/04khyOwpHX
Robert Pattinson is such a good actor wow
@HayabusaZeroZ Also it makes me hella motion sick
Describe your Twitter without downloading new images: my two moods lately https://t.co/iA4FgJhrST https://t.co/nvYVB0fhIV
I feel an obsession coming on... Iâ€™m already craving to play more
Check out Re:CoM Finale!!! Affiliate Celebration https://t.co/DVGqUYcIoE
@HayabusaZeroZ Thatâ€™s fair!!! Iâ€™m very interested so far, it seems like itâ€™s going to be good
Okay probably done for the day- this thread will be light spoilers btw, nothing crazy
@HayabusaZeroZ Good because I feel crazy and Iâ€™m like hello????
So are we gonna ignore that Kamoshida is dating a student or?????
@CJMiles_99 Okay donâ€™t push it
@starIesbian Thatâ€™s amazing! I saw you started a Persona 3 letâ€™s play! Canâ€™t wait to watch!!
@CJMiles_99 I know, you were right! (Soak it up I donâ€™t say that often) lol
@HayabusaZeroZ Oh damn i totally couldâ€™ve played that I forgot, Iâ€™ll get to that soon too lol
Okay, but this is sick and I see why people draw a JoJo comparison now
I have a stand!!
I listened- here we go!!!! Persona 5 thread!! Relatively spoiler free https://t.co/vKw6gmERAh
Also Iâ€™m book marking this tweet! I will come back to everyoneâ€™s suggestions! I appreciate it!
@starIesbian Iâ€™m down to try new things- Iâ€™m gonna end up playing both eventually, plus I just finished KH2 so I can switch it up
@starIesbian I have heard itâ€™s super longðŸ˜… but it will carry me through the rest of the semester which isnâ€™t bad
@starIesbian I have not! I bought it on sale because my friend really wanted to play it with me- then the pandemic happened lol. But I still want to play it
I have a feeling I know which way this is going to go, but... do I play
@ThePersonCarlos I have played Undertale! Idk if bloodborne is my vibe, I do own it though. Iâ€™ve been wanting to start FFXV honestly, I just need to redownload it on my PS4. Iâ€™m leaning towards P5, but FFXV is a strong # 2!!! I appreciate the recommendations! :)
@HayabusaZeroZ Currently have* Iâ€™m typing too fast too lol
@HayabusaZeroZ I will deff consider investing in it when it comes out! I trust your recommendation, I want to play something I currently, but that can be my next next game lol
@DrButtersnaps I will make you happy- I just want something chill to play like KH
I could also return to a PokÃ©mon game I havenâ€™t finished. The last option is FF7, but Iâ€™ll probably save that for the summer along with grinding for the ultima weapon in KH1FM
Okay so new game time I guess because I finished KH2 FM and I want to play another single player game. Drop suggestions down below- right now Iâ€™m thinking Persona 5, I know itâ€™s a time commitment, but itâ€™s all I have to play
I beat it! Taking a break before trying to attempt post game stuff lol
:))) https://t.co/ZvimTvICA8
Time to beat the game on level 99 tomorrow!
:) 2/3 done!!!!! https://t.co/cSmmfJd2dV
