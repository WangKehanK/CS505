i just got the cutest spring clothes and im so excited to wear them ðŸ¥º
Let it get better
The HEB parking lot on paredes stresses me out way more than it should
yeah
getting myself a handy manny bf was probably the best move iâ€™ve made so far âœ¨
i want a dog :/
The fact that I had to go to the Walmart parking lot to send an email and saw a girl stressing out trying to turn in an assignment at HEB really goes to show how fucking evil some of these professors are towards their students in turning in their assignments.
on the bright side i made potato soup before our generator went out too ðŸ™ƒ
im just finding any excuse to go outside and enjoy this cold weather ðŸ’€
