@Jim_Jordan Way to misinterpret and demonize. I guess that’s all your side really has now. I get it.
@Jim_Jordan ...for the better.
@RepMTG I’m pretty sure history will be kind to you, even though this google search wasn’t. Better turn it up a notch. After all, you have a pretty large group to out crazy.
I’m shocked, NOT surprised. #tedfled 🙄
Republicans are a bunch of pussies. The gop and q heads, all of them. Too spineless to do anything about each other.
“Terrified of being wrong I've chosen not to choose, So if you don't mind I will wait forever.”
They just seem to keep kicking the can down the road. #QAnonmeltdown  https://t.co/6KHeBhli8V
Here’s why Trump impeachment attorney Bruce Castor’s opening remarks have the ’Chewbacca Defense’ from #SouthPark trending https://t.co/BGICKlMJo0
@mtgreenee @JoeBiden We are all laughing at you 😂. You belong on a reality show not congress. Maybe fire agent.
Did you tell him there would be a camera?!?
@mtgreenee I just watch a reel of your suddenly conflicting statements. So I gotta ask, Are you crazy or is it just a persona? I guess it doesn’t really matter. They did the right thing.
@mtgreenee Be careful. The lord will smite you.
@mtgreenee @JoeBiden So the government telling women and girls what to do with their bodies is still okay right?
@mtgreenee Keep doing what you are doing so you are not overlooked when they round up and punish the others.
Hard not to look at this yet. https://t.co/pqoxxWy834
I’m actually excited to watch something! Yay! WandaVision | Official Trailer | Disney+ https://t.co/ZLcUAoHsYA via @YouTube #WandaVision
@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews For shame.
#Fuck2020
@realDonaldTrump So, How’s that whole winning that election thing going?!? 😂
@realDonaldTrump You say it’s true, yet they have flagged it.
@realDonaldTrump We can see straight through you. You turn clear in the sun. #transparency
Bring on the Best of 2020 lists for this shitty fucking year already! #Fuck2020
@realDonaldTrump @OANN @FoxNews My definition of “Hearing” does not necessarily include a rented hotel conference room.
@realDonaldTrump Everyone wants to see it. Literally everyone. We are waiting.
@DevonESawa Too much.
@realDonaldTrump Its just too bad that a convincing argument is not enough. ☹️
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I believe it’s called an algorithm. Maybe worth a google.
@realDonaldTrump Why don’t you just go play golf on our dime til it’s time for prison?
@realDonaldTrump Don’t forget the proof this time. 😂
@realDonaldTrump Protect that fragile ego at all costs.
@realDonaldTrump @gregkellyusa @newsmax And what did we all learn about polls this year?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Clutching at straws at this point don’t you think?
@realDonaldTrump First time you’ve ever put the country first and you managed to do it with zero grace. Bravo.
@realDonaldTrump You lost. You’re a loser. I like the people that don’t lose horribly, I hate to tell you. Don’t get me started on whiners. They are the worst.
@SharonLombardo0 @realDonaldTrump Incredibly misinformed. No surprise though.
@realDonaldTrump Says the guy facing prison on January 21st. You will literally do and say anything. Face it, becoming POTUS was the worst thing you could’ve done for you and your a family. You will see that soon enough. Save some money for your legal defense.
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @OANN Pretty sure my mail in ballot was made of paper.
@realDonaldTrump Close your eyes, tap your heels together three times and think to yourself “I won the Election!” 😂
@realDonaldTrump Wartime President ignores the war, tells his troops to ignore the war, the troops die, wonders why he lost he war. 🤔
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. Trump, one guess as to where your missing 240k votes went. I’ll give you a minute. 😉
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump is not capable of concession even if he counted every ballot himself.
@realDonaldTrump What was corrupt about it?
@realDonaldTrump Can’t wait till the recount when you get to lose all over again.
@realDonaldTrump Delete your Twitter account.

@GoochHolden That makes like zero sense.
@GoochHolden Hey Nerd, when is it gonna snow again?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, if you mean crime. 😂
@realDonaldTrump POTUS tweeting like his life depends on it. Kinda does. Project much? #PackYourBags #VoteHimOut
@realDonaldTrump I think you will find in the near future that becoming president was the worst thing you could’ve done to our country, your family and you.
Enjoy your last senate speech to do in women’s rights, @SenJoniErnst.  #SCOTUSHearing
@realDonaldTrump Oh okay, if you say so! It’s your watch. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
@realDonaldTrump Guy who truly believes he can win the Election says what?
#WednesdayVibes https://t.co/dOdSTlDYCi
So fucking tired of #Politics. I just want something I can go back to ignoring.
@realDonaldTrump He did, but you were talking over him.
@realDonaldTrump You’re a phony. #FakeBillionaireTrump
@kurteichenwald @senatemajldr He already knows he is going straight to hell so he’s gonna go for broke.
@realDonaldTrump Not interested in hearing you lie through your teeth to the American people again. Very soon you will be held accountable. No one will be there to pardon you.
@realDonaldTrump Worst president ever in history. Now claims to be psychic.
@realDonaldTrump You are such a disgrace.
@DGComedy Lol 😂
@ProjectLincoln Three's Company
@realDonaldTrump Also, plucked from the fascist playbook. If you look at countries with dictators, this is how it all starts.
@realDonaldTrump Straight out of the fascist playbook.
@realDonaldTrump Is that what Putin has been telling you? #FacistTrump
@Acosta What a #douche
Lots of mental gymnastics still plague many prominent Republicans that also happen to have very #PunchableFaces #barrhearing
Can’t wait to see the future docuseries about Trump’s America narrated by Daniel Stern.
Hey Democrats, I’m starting to think that we need to get us a better narcissist. Like fighting fire with hotter fire. Idk. At least the debates would be that much more entertaining. #Democrats #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
@EricTrump You shouldn’t speak....like ever. 🤫
@BruceWayne_RBX @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump So did your cell phone, but you don’t call that your China phone.
@realDonaldTrump You are such a douche.
I just yawn-burped.  Is that a thing?
@JoyAnnReid Hell yeah! You go Joy!
I’m my own worst enemy.
Goddammit, ⁦@Apple⁩. WTF? #DickMove #YouFuckingUp  https://t.co/R0Z7twLucH
@realDonaldTrump Since it’s pretty much win re-election or go to jail now, I guess I understand trying everything.
@realDonaldTrump Are you just going to keep tweeting this until it catches up with you? Then at least you can say you were right about something. #youfuckingup
@realDonaldTrump Hey, guy in glass house, is this your stone?
@CraigSh8 @TONYxTWO @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Who the fuck is winning?
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Too bad your approval rating is at an all time low.
@realDonaldTrump #NotAKing
@suzydymna @realDonaldTrump I’d like to paint you with such a broad brush, glossing over so very much.
@realDonaldTrump STILL waiting for your genius plan that’s so much better. So, maybe you’ll share it before November?
@LindseyGrahamSC That’s all you’ve done in four years. You are going straight to hell, Sir. #NoStops
@realDonaldTrump @FBIWFO You think this is the pressing issue of the day? We have had enough of all this shit about making due, playing ball, the way things are and dealing with it. See ya at the polls in November.
@realDonaldTrump You are fucking doomed.
@realDonaldTrump You are fucking doomed.
@realDonaldTrump Listening to #Biden speak. He wasn’t my guy, but at least he sounds like a fucking human being. It would be great to have a president that doesn’t sound like a toddler that missed his nap and believes it’s all your fault.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, the everyone involved in media is crazy or you are. Hmmm. #NeverOccuredToHim
