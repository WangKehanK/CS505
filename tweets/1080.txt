@PittmanSZN @matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue just bc they haven‚Äôt ‚Äúbroken out ‚Äú doesn‚Äôt mean shit lol. they contributed a lot to the packers this season, and it was very much a  pleasure to watch those guys score tds lol.
@PittmanSZN @matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue it‚Äôs not all about catching passes. lazard and mvs were also GREAT blocking WRs, which was vital to the run game. this version of the packers offense STARTS with the run. it‚Äôs why they were able to be so dynamic. everyone said the same shit about devante, look how he turned out
@PittmanSZN @matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue i mean idk man, i watched every single snap the packers took this season, lazard n mvs were at times, inconsistent, but they looked pretty damn good to me, again, THEY WERE THE #1 scoring offense
@matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue aaron rodgers is a prime example of taking a QB when u didn‚Äôt need to. *3 mvps and a super bowl title later*
@PittmanSZN @matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue i mean tonyan led TEs in touchdowns, we all know aaron jones can be a deep threat, lazard and mvs were good, rodgers has his weapons
@matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue i just don‚Äôt see how it was a problem this year. they scored the most points in the league, yes mvp n lazard were inconsistent BUT lazard had a hell of a game in the divisional round and MVS in the nfccg, both games were the stakes were high, i think they‚Äôll draft one this year
@nothaxour @matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue lazard n mvs ?
@matt14628915 @FntsyGold @RayGQue how is there a ‚Äúglaring hole at WR‚Äù if they literally were the highest scoring offense in the league ??
i copped an aaron jones jersey last year, so ducking happy he‚Äôs coming back to green bay
I &lt;3 AARON JONES https://t.co/PCxC8D41sA
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO YEAHHHHH https://t.co/6CQSMLeRxu

@six9r912 @IcyLazard @patinmadison @KingHassan__ @AdamSchefter lets get one thing straight lol, WR did not lose the packers that nfccg
summer IS better https://t.co/LG9o5bhBly
me just taking my two test today https://t.co/yTY2PP476w
@ballsohartigan @PackersHistory1 how can we ever know that tho ? we all saw devante be inconsistent as hell and most people wrote him off (myself NOT included) i was in excited abt devante and the NFCCG made me so excited for mvs, sky‚Äôs the limit
@kimitari2 NAH it‚Äôs all good i worded that tweet very poorly and it had literally just happened lol
SHOULD CLARIFY: physically didnt not ‚Äúcome after me‚Äù just was making fun of me n laughing at me lol https://t.co/hPfOMomoKk
