@unde_clared i simply am too lazy to make my own every day and too poor to buy it every day
the US starts reopening and already it’s back to mass shootings in the news cycle every damn week cool cool cool

@jaci_satter @emilymusson I realized once One Direction popped up bc I knew there was no damn way I wouldn’t have heard about a reunion 😂

@lourdestypebeat minus the actually using it tho...he had a Facebook but he never went on it so of course he thought he was superior for not using social media 🙄
@lourdestypebeat how is he the same fucking person as my abuser
@lourdestypebeat I-
@xdajexe @robertredway @RealAndyAnthony @DArijitian @BrandonDavisBD I mean I’m just saying that in your scenario that means Steve knowingly made out with his own niece who he would’ve seen grow up so.......ew lol
@xdajexe @robertredway @RealAndyAnthony @DArijitian @BrandonDavisBD But in previous films/Agent Carter it was established that Peggy married someone else and lived a whole life without him after Steve died, so going back in time and being with her would at a minimum change that 🤔
@lemonbbyx I would easily pay twice what you charged for your v hard and v appreciated work!!! Ditto for your scrunchies btw...I copped a halloween one and it’s my favorite scrunchie EVER so I am still wearing it regularly even though fall is looooooong gone 🤷🏼‍♀️
@lemonbbyx just on a (hopefully) encouraging note, i bought these from ur shop a lil while back and they have become my FAV fun earrings! i wear them all the time and have genuinely never worn them out in public without getting complements on them, so just know that ur killing it lol 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/Zs8iJymhwE

@soulmatelineugh @lisasbish ......my fav is Lisa, y’all just love to bark.
Every now and then I go down this rabbit hole of natural disasters/other awful accidents......just watched like 15 videos about the Sewol Ferry Disaster and now I’m watching a documentary about the White Island Disaster. Whyyyyyyy do I do this to myself!?
yes and for the record i am still judging any of y’all who weren’t already washing your hands properly before the pandemic 👀 https://t.co/VkaXLlzPvk
@pinksreader Lisa worked hard for her career and to accomplish all that she has individually and as a member of blackpink. The reason she is known is bc she got her start as an idol. That’s all I meant. But you guys just want to be mad so go ahead, I don’t have anything else to say.
@pinksreader You think if Lisa was just a random person who posted that video and it went viral, they would’ve asked her to be a mentor?? It’s because of her whole career as an idol/performer/member of BP. Idk why y’all are acting like it’s controversial or insulting her to say that.
@jayspatrol @cheetorprime_yt the guy who got eaten with that flashing camera around his neck, so the scary monster was just walking around with this creepy flashing camera in its stomach to create suspense *chef’s kiss*
info for anyone who needs it! https://t.co/0mszaxLs0U
@MusicianLili @LiLiEsLiLiM I haven’t done anything to drag Lisa and I have no connection to any other accounts. Just leave me alone.
@MusicianLili @LiLiEsLiLiM You are wasting your time because there is nothing to report my account for!! I haven’t done anything. You should focus on people who are actually dragging Lisa.
@MusicianLili @LiLiEsLiLiM It’s seriously not me, you are wasting your time.
@MusicianLili Like use your brain and look at my account - I’m not even a stan account. I just made the mistake of responding to one tweet about Lisa and a bunch of people came at me.
@MusicianLili That’s literally not me
@MusicianLili Report me for what, exactly??
@MusicianLili Lmaoooooo what a reach
@Lalalisaslay1 I just meant that being an idol is how she was able to show the world her talents...being an idol/being in BP is what gave her a platform to show the world what she can do. That is all.
@Lalalisaslay1 You guys are determined to make this into some kind of insult when that’s not how I meant it. I only said BP because that’s the group she debuted with. Being an idol is what made her famous and how she was able to show the world her talents. That’s all I meant.
@MusicianLili @ysapocalyps I mean you could simply.......go away
@Rahcellilie @Jisoosooya7 @lisasbish That’s not what I meant. I just meant if she weren’t an idol she wouldn’t be a dance mentor on the show, bc that’s how she was able to show the world her talent. Being an idol/being in BP is what gave her a platform to show the world what she can do. That is all I meant.
@LSSOLOIST @spicytamsz @lisasbish YG uses them all to make money and doesn’t appreciate them. They don’t credit them in songs they contribute to until this year and even then BARELY. They delay their comebacks and solo debuts. I think it impacts all four though Lisa gets it the worst.
@Lalalisaslay1 LSB didn’t exist until Lisa was a trainee though. I’m just saying she’s famous bc she’s an idol. That’s why we know who she is and why she has opportunities and fans. This isn’t even an insult or controversial, it’s just a fact.
@Lalalisaslay1 I’m not even arguing with you, you’re literally just arguing with yourself at this point 😂
@lisaismybich @Axl_lilie_Gunz @liliwithcats @lisasbish It’s still a song from a Korean group that they played though...so how is it different from showing a lightstick for a Korean group?? The lightstick wasn’t speaking in Korean either like what is your point lol??
@ysapocalyps I mean.....thanks for making her famous, yeah. We wouldn’t be talking about her right now if she weren’t so idk what your issue is.
@LSSOLOIST @spicytamsz @lisasbish The company uses all four of them for everything. They’re YG’s cash cows and it’s sad. It’s been like 5 years of complaining and they still haven’t changed their ways 😔
@ysapocalyps No, thank you kpop for giving Lisa Manoban a platform. That’s all I’m saying.
@LISJKARI1 I agree with that. I love Lisa. I just like the group too, it’s not a competition to me 🤷🏼‍♀️ as long as I get to see Lisa performing and she is happy, that’s all I want for her.
@puszyfairy Ok but this is reality and in reality, she got famous by becoming an idol and being in blackpink. So what is your issue??
@Lalalisaslay1 You guys are just trying to start fights now twisting my words 🙄 it’s just a simple fact, none of us would know who Lisa is and we wouldn’t know her talent if she weren’t an idol/in BP. That’s all I meant.
@LSSOLOIST @spicytamsz @lisasbish I understand why you are all worried! I just don’t think this approach is going to help her. It is just calling more attention to it and I think it will get her dragged even more now.
@soonliliManobal No - I am just saying you have NO IDEA what agreement was made between YG and YWY or what went into that decision, but you guys act like you know everything and blow it up online. I don’t think it was a good idea, but you are all making it worse now.
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish The Japanese version of a kpop song by a kpop group........and they didn’t talk about the  lightsticks either or try to sell them or anything like that, they were just sitting there. It probably would be better to have not done it, but you all are just making it worse now.
@soonliliManobal Where do you think I changed my words??? She wouldn’t be a dance mentor if she weren’t an idol. She shouldn’t have to be ashamed of her group. What did I change??
@LSSOLOIST @spicytamsz @lisasbish Yep, both seasons! I also watched the episode where YWY showed trainees dancing and singing to Kill This Love, and I didn’t see anyone drag Lisa for that. If Lisa gets dragged for the lightstick issue now, I think it will be bc you all drew this extra attention to it.
@bebecitabrrr @soonliliManobal You guys do not know everything and you act like you do! How do you know YG and YWY didn’t have an agreement about promo and product placement? You just assume and blow it up online and I don’t think that actually helps Lisa. That is just my opinion.
@soonliliManobal I know about the weibo issue and that Lisa was dragged for promoting BP’s comeback. I know the tension between China and South Korea and that there’s an unofficial ban on content from SK. I know why you are all worried. I just think you’re making the situation worse with this.
@Lalalisaslay1 Being in BP is what made her a famous dancer, and that’s why she was asked to be on the show. That’s literally all I’m saying. The same is true for all the other girls too - being in BP is what gave them a platform. Y’all are doing too much.
@lalicesolo_ @soonliliManobal What issue am I diverting...? I was just responding to what someone else tweeted at me.
@bebecitabrrr @soonliliManobal I do know! I just don’t think you guys are helping. You are only pointing it out more and making more people notice.
@soonliliManobal Where did I say anything about her talent!!? Of course she is talented. And I didn’t say she was there for group promotion. I just said she got the opportunity to be on the show because she is an idol/in BP. Chinese gp know she is in BP.
@avemariasaint You also have no idea what Lisa’s contract states or what agreement YG and YWY made about promo/product placement. But you all act like you know everything and go online screaming about it. Immature.
@avemariasaint I understand what you guys are saying, I just don’t agree with you. Did they criticize Lisa when trainees sang/danced to Kill This Love on the same show? Bc I didn’t see it happen. Why would they over a lightstick? But they probably will now that you all made it into a big deal.
@soonliliManobal Idk if you guys just can’t understand or if you’re misunderstanding on purpose. I am not criticizing Lisa. Lisa is my bias and she’s the best dancer in kpop. It is just a fact that none of us would know who she is if she weren’t an idol/in blackpink.
@Axl_lilie_Gunz @liliwithcats @lisasbish Did they criticize her when trainees sang and danced to Kill This Love on the show earlier this season? Bc I sure didn’t see that happen. So why would they over a lightstick? They probably will now that you all made it into a big deal, though.
@MeowCat97 @puszyfairy I do understand. But you all act like you know everything &amp; you don’t. You don’t know what her contract states or what terms YG and YWY agreed to for promo/product placement. They already played a BP song on the show, why would a lightstick be a bigger problem than that...?
@Axl_lilie_Gunz @lisasbish Y’all don’t know anything but you act like you do. You don’t know what her contract states. You don’t know what terms YG and YWY agreed to for promo/product placement. They already played a BP song on the show, why would a light stick be a bigger problem than that...? Use logic.
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish Also if the show was ok with playing a BP song and showing trainees dancing and singing to it, why would a lightstick be an issue...? Use logic.
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish Ok but you don’t know what her contract states. You don’t know what deal YG and YWY made about promo/product placement. You guys are just making assumptions and getting angry.
@spicytamsz @lisasbish What’s embarrassing is fans on the internet acting like they know everything about how to manage Lisa when you don’t have all the info. You don’t know what her contract states. You don’t know what YG or YWY agreed to in terms of promo/product placement. Don’t act like you do.
@spicytamsz @lisasbish I do, I just think y’all are the only ones making this into a problem and calling more attention to it. Like y’all are complaining about a lightstick when they literally already showed trainees dancings/singing to a whole ass BP song earlier in the season?? 🙄
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish I understand the situation is complicated with China but I think people trying to help are making this a bigger deal and just calling more attention to it. She IS in blackpink. That’s why she’s a mentor on the show, even if they don’t talk about it bc of complicated issues.
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish Yes. I am saying Lisa would not have been invited to be a mentor on the show if she weren’t an idol. So why should she now have to hide that she’s in blackpink?? It’s not like people in China don’t already know this.
@liliwithcats @lisasbish That sounds like a personal problem babe. Lisa has a career because of BP and the other girls are her friends. Sad that you have so much hate in your heart for people that Lisa loves. I doubt she’d approve.
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish I watched last season too.
@LiLiEsLiLiM @lisasbish Yep
@puszyfairy how sad, now u have none left :(
That’s not what u said when u took my money for a ham and pineapple pizza last week, Domino’s!!!!!! 👀 https://t.co/vftlRV89Nw
@Jisoosooya7 @lisasbish Lisa wouldn’t be a dance mentor on YWY if she wasn’t in blackpink...you can’t say there’s no connection/relevance.
@SAlashmoney @stanacekpop @Tarb14Tarb @10BWonBangs @lisasbish If they already know she’s a part of an overseas Korean group, why would simply seeing a lightstick change anything...?
@lisasbish she wouldn’t be a dance mentor on the show if she weren’t a member of blackpink...that’s why she’s famous and why the world has been able to see her talent. you think she should be ashamed of blackpink and hide her connection to her group or something just bc this is a solo gig?

@lemonbbyx LEMONADE MOUTH SOUNDTRACK ASKDKDJDHDHDJD MOOD
tell me why i’m having a breakdown over my former abuser who i haven’t seen/spoken to in over 4 years out of the clear ass blue rn???  i’d give ANYTHING to get rid of these feelings even this far out from it all idk how to make it stopppppp
@Cat_Marnell IT! But I would highly recommend that you do the audiobook version - it’s a game changer in terms of the overall experience tbh. Pet Sematary is great as an audiobook too!
@Amander007 plz pretend i can spell asdkfkfhfhf
@heythatnikki @Amander007 Either that or he’d sexually harass you on Facebook like other women in podcasting and their fans 🙄 he’s the biggest piece of shit in the podcasting medium that I’ve had the misfortune to come across
@Amander007 Literally not an even slightly hot take!!! He has been such loud and proud trash for so many years it’s shocking to me that he hasn’t exlerienced more fallout tbh so BRING IT
I don't let him touch me anymore I said “I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored” 'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door
@blessup_honest “I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors to find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door” was my life for a solid 8 years and I can’t stop cRYING
