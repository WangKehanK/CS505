@reebytalk @realDonaldTrump i would say that he gets re-elected, but we already know that that’s happening... so i hope he silences the liberal media instead!

@medmalrn @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump why Sherry? because he’s black?
@boparker1 @blueslesson @mcconnellmike11 @LMSNCUS @w_terrence lmao obviously that hasn’t been the case for a long time. the left is actively justifying censorship and political violence and the right is slowly moving that way. you’re watching america fall apart rn.
@Twitter why did you take the top trending thing off? you’re a joke.
@Iksorb i know right!!!?? i’m so excited rn, they’re not getting away with this one!
#ClintonBodyCount @Twitter can’t silence us.
@hhushyourmouthh *bill clinton*
@sonicclang you’re a stupid pretentious schmuck
@LuluMcTavish epstein was murdered. he was on 24 hour suicide watch. don’t buy the bs they’re feeding you.
@freethought777 for the record, can you please tell us if you are planning on mysteriously committing suicide any time soon?
retweeting this for when Manafort is found dead https://t.co/4jR5gjieMp
@Andylindrossa he was on 24hr suicide watch. that man was murdered.
@BethPapaleo he was murdered.
rich white dudes with the news that #epstein “killed himself” https://t.co/nFGKyzi99c
#Epstein was on 24 hour suicide watch... i call bs. that man was murdered.
@crazycatlacly come on, he definitely didn’t kill himself.
@unkindled_dude this man was on 24 hour suicide watch... he didn’t kill himself
@EricJacobJohns1 he was on 24 hour suicide watch... that man didn’t kill himself.
@yeeee_haww he didn’t kill himself, that much is obvious
@BriannaWu epstein got suicided. i’m in disbelief that they would do it to him, how fucking obvious is that.
america: *has by and large the most liberal and welcoming immigration laws in the world, welcoming more immigrants with less requirements than pretty much anywhere else* trump: *says that we should enforce those laws* dumb asses: “RACIST!!!”
@BernieSanders cool bernie, how are we gonna pay for it?
@BernieSanders .... and i’ve maintained a 3.9 GPA in college while sometimes working as much as 12 hour days. it’s really not that hard at all. you are just not good at being an adult so you want to whine about it. grow tf up and live in the world you’ve been given.
@BernieSanders lmao that’s nothing. as a senior in hs i was working 40 hour weeks while paying$800+ of bills and doing AP classes (all 5s 😉). i’ve done the same in college with $1000+ of bills. it’s not hard. stop whining and grow tf up.
@dgmtick1 @VP @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin @HHSGov oh so now that a Republican is in office you wanna care about debt? don’t worry, the Dems will be in soon enough and then you’ll be able to ignore it again.
@sonic0357 @VP @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin @HHSGov he’s VP of the most powerful nation on earth, you’re some old schmuck on twitter
@MichaelCoudrey @BetoORourke i’m right wing af michael, and you’re wrong here. he’s obviously trying not to cry.
@favora_2018 @larryelder @donlemon FBI crime statistics are a great place to start since you’re upset about these being old! don’t worry, they haven’t changed too much...
@Gabe27950772 @larryelder @donlemon whites aren’t 13% of the US population tho... they’re like over 50%? do you know how ratios work?
@BillyBobSanderz @Mary_Quinif lmao you know that most companies contribute to both.... right?
@Ford @cowboyjoe_40 by “@Ford Family” they mean hiding serious mechanical issues which they knew about from their customers. just had to replace a clutch in the transmission for $2000. i hope they’re not hiding any bugs in your car.
@Ford explain to me why you sold cars with transmission errors you knew about, and maybe throw in $2000 to pay me back for having to fix it.
@Ford @Mac_350 my Focus’ transmission just blew out because of a problem @Ford knew about. for your sake, i hope they aren’t hiding anything on this model.
@Ford @Mxleek probably the fact that you all sold cars with transmission problems you knew about
@nazAgoha @brendoskii_ (tweeted from my iPhone X)
@nazAgoha @brendoskii_ most girls don’t think the same way tho... you’ve just surrounded yourself with shallow bitches to the point that you think this kind of idiotic materialism is normal.
@Ford care to explain why you shipped my 2014 Focus with transmission problems you knew about?
@ashlynstagr8 remember next time you go on a boat that they’re made for baths, not open sea!
@ashlynstagr8 you literally got on a boat once bitch
@ashlynstagr8 wait wait wait.... when did you go on a boat?
@ashlynstagr8 wait you were on a boat?
