💛put a heart emoji first because we lead with love.
It take a certain type of man to teach. To be far from hood but to understand the streets.
The accuracy 😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/KKmWjurn6c
It’s not a race it’s a marathon. And the marathon will always continue.
Establish community with good intent.
They create the pain and sell you the pill.
@japsingh713 @zariaroyale Lmfaoooooo
This tweet gave me aneurysm. https://t.co/xzfpA1ki5E
Less hearing More listening.
The truth will always be overwhelming.
Moderation is a virtue.
Hop out the echo chamber and smell the roses.
If you eat ass (literally and figuratively) don’t worry about the mask mandate.
@japsingh713 @yazbashar @yazxhh Honestly never messed with any of this stuff anyways #respectfully
@japsingh713 @yazbashar @yazxhh Exactly he and his counterparts are about to fake a water shortage so he can swoop in and offer us his poop water solution

There is a major difference between believing and submitting your will.
@donato_GP Allahu akbar!
Secrets of the world wrapped in silence.
Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.
Feed the soul before feeding the belly.
All I see is scapegoating. Nothing about addressing the root of the problem. Politics is one hell of a drug!
Imagine having your perception of reality based on Twitter. Reevaluate your standards #respectfully
Idk who needs to hear this, but shutchyo fake woke ass up.
Truth is treason in an empire of lies.
There’s a war going on; the battle field in the mind; the price is the soul.
“Three things can’t be long hidden; the sun, the moon, and the truth”
@K_Kaz94 Poop man with the poop plan
@K_Kaz94 In other words.. just another facade of looking like the hero.
@K_Kaz94 This dude is unnecessarily extra. The earth is literally 70+% water with an abundance of Primary Water sources. Technically nobody should go thirsty, but millions do because they’ve turned water into a monopoly.
Truth is beyond logical comprehension. Never mistake the map for the territory.
The fact that there are people who think Bill Gates is the ‘hero’ in this realm of ours really gives me a sense of uneasiness amongst the collective consciousness.
There needs to be a new gold standard to own a drivers license. This getting outta hand.
Believe what you want that’s between you and your creator.
@farahpeutic Yin to the Yang
Time will tell ALL.
Our parents generation had Wonder Woman. Our generation has to wonder if it’s a woman.
It’s always nice to remember corporations don’t do the right thing, they only do the profitable thing.
Ego will never accept truth.
Don’t let em pull you into their storm; pull them into your peace.
@ZacharyHClarke School of thought

@donato_GP Not what I was referring to but most def
@japsingh713 Another form of propaganda essentially
The education system has failed us all.
If you ever want a good chuckle just remember that some of the most morally corrupt people in our history have been doctors.
...why does he sound like he’s being forced to tweet this while being held at gun point https://t.co/aD5F5SY2ND
@CoreyBroady 😂😂😂
@Lavar_Bald 😂😂😂 damn you took it to another level
I’d tell y’all a joke about covid, but 99% of y’all wouldn’t get it 😞
Putting ‘science’ before the mercy of God will misconstrue your perspective of life.
The most valuable currency you hold is the effect have on others.
@new_branches DONE O  N E
@japsingh713 🤣🤣🤣🤣
XRP will be the new Gold Standard.
