It's my #Twitterversary! I have been on Twitter for 10 years, since 21 Feb 2011 (via @twi_age).
@TheeAlexLawson I’m glad he thinks everyone has the option of living with roommates or parents. What about school? What about a car? What about groceries and utilities and emergencies? Children? Also you shouldn’t have to work two full time jobs to do that.
@BellaBizzyBody @BinweA @Danlawrence21 @Cold_Case_Love I never said he was embarrassed but ok
@BellaBizzyBody @BinweA @Danlawrence21 @Cold_Case_Love 😂😂😂 i work with kids. Teach them self help skills and confidence and they’ll be fine. But parents would rather just do it for them.
@myman50grand The child is 7...old enough to be responsible and remember the things he should remember. And if he can’t remember, isn’t that the parents’ job? Shouldn’t they be working on recalling memories? “What did Mrs. whatever say today in class? What did you learn about in math?” Like ??
@GOPLeader Do schools have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate those kids safely? What about poor and low income neighborhoods who don’t even have enough books or computers? Are you sending them money to open or just throwing those kids to the wolves?
I caaaaaaant handle it 😂😂
@BinweA @Danlawrence21 @Cold_Case_Love The teacher commenting “how sad” to a kid is talking down? Teach your kid how to handle their own problems. Maybe talk to your kid about their teacher and they wouldn’t forget? Parents forget they’re part of the learning process.
@bbylov1221 @_omnificent_ Really? Like how would the story have changed at all if some of them where POC? 🙄 nothing would be different. Honestly it probably would’ve been better.
@_omnificent_ Dude Jasper was straight up a confederate soldier. Not great.
@GOP Almost like all GOP were afraid to upset Trump and their chances of re-election by holding him accountable for his actions.   We won’t forget this is the party of cowards and insurrectionists.
@GOPLeader And what about poorer neighborhoods? Are they getting government assistance to pay for these safety measures? Or are poor brown and black students getting fucked again?
@GOP And in the history books we’ll remember when you caged migrant children at the border too. Did you remember the internment camps then? Or just today?
@HadleyWilliams_ Text me your switch code thing and we can play together !!!
@VE_Bula @KeatonPatti @FauxRameNoodle it’s because instead of being one with the Texans who are suffering he decided to use his privilege to avoid the issue. Could he have single handedly solved the issue, no, but could he have done something to try to help, absolutely. He decided to fuck off instead of do his job
@britneywilliams @Kiing_alysha @msesq @TravisAllen02 Yes! Exactly! Republicans lack of self awareness is getting ridiculous
@ndrew_lawrence They are on their own privatized power grid and their equipment hasn’t been made to withstand this type of weather. This isn’t bc solar power or wind power isn’t good, it’s bc Texas leadership is dumb and greedy. They can gtfo 🙄
@gregsandiego @kylegriffin1 They’d rather reprimand the republicans doing the right thing than hold Trump accountable for his actions.
@ImPeachMint3 @RachelMComedy @AlbyWeiser Working day jobs, living their lives. Doing other sex work to pay bills. Some already have degrees
@RachelMComedy Most service industry people only like you bc they’re getting paid. Strippers aren’t special in that way 😂 I hate how people make strippers out to be bad bc of that. Like let them LIVE
@HadleyWilliams_ Also like, what does that accomplish? Like now she looks like a dick even if she got to keep the article. Or a dick and dumb if she didn’t. Like ???
@cronander @JXDart @DuskEther @Chuckfug “You”....is also singular....while using “you are”. Sooo I don’t think you made the point you’re trying to make 😂
I hope he gets convicted criminally in Georgia. This whole trial on the republicans part is a farce. We could literally have video evidence of trump admitting guilt and they still wouldn’t convict him.
@RepCarlos @GOPLeader Yeah capitalism is so great. It’s so wonderful that some people are dying from treatable illness because corporations can make the price of medicine whatever they want and insurance doesn’t have to cover it. And then some people go into debt and go homeless trying to get meds. A+
@bdrizzlet And on top of that people have the audacity to think rich and famous black women are exempt. They aren’t. Money and influence don’t matter to racists.
@LaFontaine70 @Sam11416 @ryankberry04 @SethAbramson Agreed. That’s so frustrating. I don’t understand how you can listen to trumps speech and not think he incited the insurrection and how the next speech he gave doesn’t make that even more clear when he said he loved them. Like ??? The mental gymnastics they’re able to accomplish
@Sam11416 @ryankberry04 @SethAbramson But they aren’t doing anything bc they care about being re-elected. If they had term limits and didn’t have to worry about their reelection, they’d have more incentive to do the right thing.
@GOPLeader Reagan was a POS who let countless gay men and women die because he defunded AIDS research. And he’s the one that implemented stop and frisk and the war on drugs. Maybe you shouldn’t look up to someone who doesn’t care about the American people?

@NBCNews He does know that each state has different standards for “organic” so that word doesn’t really mean anything and him doing that is like a child throwing a tantrum and not wanting what’s for dinner. Let him not eat, he’ll eat when he’s hungry.
@alissajr23 @WWEonFOX @EdgeRatedR @WWENXT Is WWE worth watching again? Mid 2000’s was so disappointing with the bad acting and the bad storylines. Is it better?
@mtracey So gaslighting isn’t an abuse tactic?
@amber_athey @mtracey @SpectatorUSA That’s not at all what she’s doing. And you misconstruing her words and painting her as a problem is literally what she’s talking about. Instead of blaming the people who did the insurrection, y’all want to point blame at the victims. Just like people do to sexual assault victims
@ryleetate Omg me too what’s her @?
@glowyaquarius It is extremely weird, bc it means only rich people can afford to adopt which is problematic and gives white kids an advantage to being adopted. however, if you adopt from foster care it’s Way cheaper and you’ll be helping a child who may not get adopted otherwise
@rchris7nd @spencer_chubb @AOC Ok and all the others saying they were protestors? Ted Cruz, Hawley, the rep from Colorado who was giving out Pelosi’s whereabouts on Twitter? All the reps who afterwards still contested the election? There’s some who are, but there’s plenty who aren’t and that’s the problem.
@spencer_chubb @AOC Bc the republicans aren’t condemning them or labeling them as Insurrectionists. The party that created them needs to distance themselves and condemn their ideology but they don’t, because all they care about are their votes in upcoming elections
@NevaWhoTay @jazzidly I mean like it’s just rude. Don’t snatch stuff out of my hands let alone off my face, and claim to be friends and they acted like it was no big deal even tho she was clearly upset about it. Lashes can be expensive and she could’ve ruined them by just ripping them off.
@bellla______ I’d be so pissed. I don’t blame her for walking off
