We can take it to the day that I saw you on your way to the top. Or we can take it to the time that I saw you lose your mind and give up. Everybody gets down on luck. Every time you fall I’ll try to pick you up, but I need reciprocation.

But I’m so close, I can feel it. Can you feel it?”  Intro to the Warm Up -@JColeNC
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups,  seems like it gives you more losses than wins.  But do you stand tall and be bold or do you fold? Do you believe? See, me, I came a long way.  Way too far for me to stop now. Not that I would stop anyways.
“You ever prayed for something your whole life? I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing. You know it’s coming, you have faith and all that. But sometimes, sometimes you second guess yourself. That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing.
“Replace the hot lava flow with the cool breeze of kindness and thoughtfulness.”
“The eruption of anger in a volcano of strong emotions can actually harm your body as well as your relationships.”
And keep your poison to yourself, even when you’re hurting. https://t.co/FylFVaHoZK
