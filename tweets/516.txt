@dscottsibley @DecideOrSlide And I think red flags should always be seen in a relationship, brought to attention by anybody close to the person and something that shouldn’t be ignored if that is somebody you see a future with because it can get bad and it can just be a waste of time to get married.
@dscottsibley @DecideOrSlide The one thing that stood out to me the most about preventing divorce were paying attention to red flags and noticing red flags before marriage. There can be so many red flags in a relationship before the marriage that a person ignores or is blind to due to the love they have.
@dscottsibley @DecideOrSlide When I read things or see things about divorce and the risks, I always think and compare them to my parents and the things I seen that were risky and how they ended in a divorce. Reading the article it’s provided many insights on how to prevent adivorce.
