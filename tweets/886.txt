@Groteskerie @cstiger_viki @CSGO Valve, I think CSGO is going in the wrong direction. I know you're Freemasons but you gotta stop with all the occult symbols and the socialist subliminal propaganda. It's way over the top. We get it. Masculine female non-white  characters are your thing but it doesnt fit CSGO.

@NBCSPhilly pain.
@Benlen17 mitch would have been voted out if amy mcgrath didnt overfund youtube ads. she put a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths with ad saturation (sounds dumb, but it was bad, like really fucking bad). lesson learned moving forward hopefully.
@Benlen17 as someone that grew up in kentucky and didnt move away until 5 years ago, you honestly have no idea the scale of agony he has caused in my homestate, and the brainwashing that has happened on the ky population as a result. one of the worst states to live in yet stays red.
