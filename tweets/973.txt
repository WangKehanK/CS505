@BStew502 @Ryan_Psych @336Jordi LMAOOOO
@336Jordi @venduhI @Ryan_Psych @BStew502 Nothing anyone could do about it. It’d be like a diabetic screaming he was on insulin. No offense to rayswag
@venduhI @Ryan_Psych @336Jordi @BStew502 It was all a mind game. If you knew you knew. Should’ve seen them boys across from us. QUIVERING
@Ryan_Psych @336Jordi @BStew502 LMAO all I can think about is Stew getting meme’d by Silly, Arcitys and co which lead to a “chall” that got dodged ironically by a professional player whom we won’t name
@Symbolizms bRo I tHoUgHt SeJ wAs GoOd aT gHoStS  Proceeds to post the ONE map I’m put in 1v2s and 1v3s at bomb sites since we got Leroy the Lost Loafer Loyal getting blooded in mid and Swear I’d Slap em Silly on my host SymBot playing a game of solos.

@GoXxLy Yeah? You sure about that?
@Mystvc That’s true for the most part, unfortunately I have you beat there buddy. I can watch someone get 720 ladder stalled and still be like “Good try” I might have to fight back involuntary laughter, but I don’t ever get mad.. You already know you got shit on, why would I repeat it 😂
@daBoyMo Just today?? That’s more than 1 pack of Ramen.. I’m jealous
@ImPreware The game can’t handle multiple inputs at a single time lmao
New meta? Hmm.. what should we call it?  • Hulk Jumping • Thunder Thrusting • Air Boosting • Lazer Leaping • Zip Zapping • Other  All I know is.. this shit’s OP as fuck! No idea how it’s possible for a game to be THIS broken 😂 https://t.co/o5LkkKLnhx

@Barryturntables Like this? https://t.co/PBiNUwmwSI
@Rayswag_ I knew mistakes were made the moment I saw 8 feet touch the ground simultaneously
I could nearly exterminate the entirety of superstore and hear, “lmk when it’s safe to come out!”  Yet these guys seem to have mastered the art of “Chemistry” I’m talkin they’ve perfected some sort of battle formation.. even the way they exited the vehicle was synchronized.. https://t.co/Clkm3xKaXU
@RyanGasais So this must be the representation of everyone who’s good at it then, huh? https://t.co/UEux1Qcv7z
@RyanGasais Good! Hopefully they fixed the game
Yeah just wait til I figure out how to abuse this shit https://t.co/VbVUrAlRYp
@TylerVeNuMz Or do you miss the thought of?
@_xanzy Sue him 😂 “valuable time wasted”
@MRuiz989 @dominos @ChickfilA Yeah you won’t make it in time, they’re closed in about 3 hours ago

@fiosGreedy Still can’t believe you lied to those chicks about “not having your ID” just so you can play more warzone.. you truly are built different

“What’s your aim response curve type?” - @Symbolizms  “Uhhh 0.25” - @fiosGreedy
I’m pissed I ran out of people to shoot at 😡 grabbed every single “most wanted” I could find, just so I could keep the gunfights coming 😂 https://t.co/ecXqpIQjEe
@fiosGreedy @JMoney_vv @Rayswag_ Na can’t say I use ‘text to speech’ but I did read it. Lmao try amazon tho
@fiosGreedy @JMoney_vv @Rayswag_ Creds covered?
@wraiIs @Broliic @Symbolizms Dude you can’t just tag Symbol to a post of someone else being the “best main AR” he’s gonna go crazyyyy
@Rayswag_ @JMoney_vv Alright, you convinced me.. I’ll go too
@shootynotshotty You and me both
GB Admins love to say “on the rules page it clearly states everything you must know regarding the tournament” but throw consistent curve balls lmfao  you deadass can’t make this shit up https://t.co/ZvtSKmLNMn
@sweetpotatoPete I must’ve misunderstood your reply then, I apologize
@sweetpotatoPete What I quoted to you was the full video of what you quoted saying “what’d he do? sad stuff” showing you exactly what he did.  I’m confused now though cause now you’re saying he deserved it which isn’t what you stated when you quoted it. I thought you were making him seem innocent
@sweetpotatoPete It’s the one of the paralyzed dude getting tazed. You have a valid point on full videos, the media loves to portray shit however they wish for it to be viewed. However, you can’t argue that the paralyzed dude is amongst one of those deceptions.  Then you quote that as a hypocrite
@sweetpotatoPete Didn’t you tweet someone else something like, “I’m only saying we don’t know the story itself” on a tweet that had no need to be explained?  Well here’s the story to your “sad stuff” maybe you should start taking your own advice https://t.co/Vc5RzKFGiQ
@Poorlyasf Ye
@niallhazaz @graceshade5 @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams So you’re telling me you “care” this much about their safety to speak up about a damn mask, but you don’t “care” enough to speak up about the racism... NOTED  I’m lacking common sense? Na, I don’t think so.. I think you’re lacking a heart. You sound dumb af! Pls, do tell me more!
@niallhazaz @graceshade5 @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams You think that’s not taken into consideration?? You think they ‘WANT’ to risk their lives? Lives are already endangered regardless to the virus with all of the racism being displayed! “High risk, high reward” Is there a lockdown? Oh.. no, I recall the lockdowns being uplifted
@graceshade5 @niallhazaz @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams They’re responding to me I believe, that was who I first questioned. Though, I did acknowledge that y’all had a good point. I was only asking if that was the ‘only’ concern. Seeing as people (in a whole) seem to be ignoring the other present issue. I’m just very sarcastic is all.
@niallhazaz @graceshade5 @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams Exactly my point. You replied, in regards of covid 19, to a post where they’re raising awareness of racism.
@graceshade5 @niallhazaz @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams I’m not even disagreeing that masks shouldn’t being worn, im just pointing out that there’s a huge issue being missed. Seems like they wanted to distract people from the fact that the racism present is absurd. Do you see my point of view now?
@graceshade5 @niallhazaz @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams You do realize face masks are ideally for those who already HAVE the virus. It doesn’t prevent you from getting it 🤦‍♂️  So don’t call me stupid when you don’t understand how it works lmfaooo
@glennagain99 @niallhazaz @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams I must’ve hit a collateral LMAO you’re HURT
@JahPhilMe @babyguayaba @Bzr924 @GabrielYadel Na he was celebrating like in this gif..  Gravity just be like that sometimes... TRUST  Besides, just cause I lift a pen to a pad doesn’t mean I’m actually about to write.. https://t.co/SI9KOrEe2U
@zelmorgof @CateVinelle Oh you should’ve seen the ones I didn’t get the kill for lmfao
@niallhazaz @joonhopekook @RMs_Jams What a great question, Karen  Is that all you’ve observed? No other issues? Genuinely curious
@CateVinelle I had 27 kills with over 10k damage, but this right here was just the least damage I’ve dealt for kills. It’s due to 3rd partying fights lmao easiest kills you can get https://t.co/f9DKmLHFkM
@Rayswag_ He 100% screamed in your ear
@MRuiz989 https://t.co/noBwnDFStM
@Clayster @JackBox Has got to be using Auto Tac Sprint. He’s just grazing his sticks
@TCronzz UMG is worse lmao they literally said there’s a “50/50” chance that we’re enrolled in a tournament.. like they didn’t even know themselves LMFAO  (We joined a tournament within “registration” time but after “check in” time) https://t.co/Cu7sMtrcFq
@BNellyNelson https://t.co/dX2dLmK2nA
@Rayswag_ Send the WZ chall
@Riviction_ ii
@John287 Completely turn off your console and then boot back up, it should work
@fiosGreedy Mask off
@Rayswag_ @AaronSupreme Ahhhh I figured you had a primary too
@Rayswag_ @AaronSupreme You better not miss then if you wanna squad wipe ;)
@AaronSupreme Mp7 is broken, no damage fall off so range doesn’t lose damage. Plus 60 round mags over 30 is wayyyyy better for taking out whole squads as opposed to just 1 op. Grau and M4 are superior tho imo (60 round mags as well)
