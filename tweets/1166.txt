@teenoki You’ve put in your time bro!!! You should be proud of that too haha but keep on the look out for what’s new 👀👀👀
@Viicckkaayy Totally try something new :) (of course everyone has their own circumstances but thinking about it is a good starting point!!! :3)
@Viicckkaayy I mean, it just depends on circumstance! I’ve had people not like their job anymore, some have outgrown their positions, and some just want to try something new so if you just step back and really think your work is really working more for you than you of them, then you should
