@GovRonDeSantis When do you think people 60 and older, with no medical conditions, will be able to be vaccinated? I’m a retired teacher patiently waiting my turn.
I’m always looking for former students that are #gatorrunlifers https://t.co/fpbhpPag1D
@RonDeSantisFL How much longer before people over 60, with good health, will be able to get vaccinated?
Way to go!! My former 5th grader @GatorRunElem #gatorrunlifer https://t.co/6J2OP7z3qV

Hopefully all teachers shared “History in the Making” today! During my 36 years of teaching I always made sure that I did! Ss understand at their own level.
Nonstop tears etc!! How wonderful! https://t.co/bgtVaQTnW7
In 1980 in South Florida my starting salary was $10,000. I couldn’t even live on it! My parents had to help me out. But I have no regrets. I loved being a teacher for 36 years! https://t.co/nmZlHZYNaT

@RokuSupport As of yesterday when I turn on my TV the screen displays a completely different Roku design and now my Roku isn’t working. Help please.
