@theevelinstone In your face they are
@SecYellen @SecYellen , Daily volume gains tax, of 1-2% if reinvested, in an open public blockchain, could pay off the national debt, &amp; give the USA a reserve of 3x, the current national debt. Imagine what that does for the whole world.
@CFR_org It‚Äôs the largest human migration ever, automation displaces all those jobs, creating the worlds largest homelessness problems. Those living conditions will be so bad, they only reinforce concentration camps in xinjiang as a good place to live!? Oh...  they wanna export that?

The Bodhi tree, was a seed, carried from Burma, by a teacher. The area, was cleansed w/fire, before it was planted. Yrs friendship tie/training the tree. They taught children, with art. The second year's seeds, were collected, in a jar, buried, on sight.  https://t.co/ZOiSyPibmy
@PIB_Patna @GayaFob Why at a place of truth, like the bhodi tree, there are those who attempt to deceive monks &amp;  old ladies? with signs that are not true.  I know, the branch was found. It was a mistake? The tree did not leave it for you?
@MickJagger @Spotify https://t.co/mFIEKJcigi
@Abroham22 @HFiskJohnson @SCJohnson @PlasticBank That's awesome.  I hate packaging in general that everything comes in, just seems like ppl pay for packaging, then it ends up in water, then ppl gotta pay to remove that.  Packaging should be made of tree seeds or something.  It'd make more sense.
@HFiskJohnson @SCJohnson @PlasticBank Filtering plastic in major rivers, before it reaches the ocean, could be a great start, what with new infrastructure, like bridges in the gameplan.
@BrookingsFP @dbyman @egavactip See much news use the keyphrase #LeaderlessOpposition ?

@ODNIgov @VP You wan me to their open puff containers &amp; passwords? I can break them with pen &amp; paper....
@ODNIgov @VP I mean, nobody in IC, wants to work with them anymore, so they work with prostitutes &amp; charge card hackers?  Wtf?
@ODNIgov @VP When disgruntled EX-DNI Allways gotta work with RF slaves &amp; open puff, cause nobody wanted their Chinese one child policy or anti-abortion rhetoric, when they were caught engineering all school shootings, nobody wants to work with them...
@VancityReynolds @jessicamalaty Ain't that real as fuck...
Cleaned up flower beds and sewed seeds today.  Also, found this.... https://t.co/Hhowu48kLx
@AOC Both parties circumvent the national defense strategy, with immigration reform, that doesn't help, immigrants, citizens, or their political causes.
@ODNIgov @ENERGY @SecGranholm @Pfizer @CIA @NSA @POTUS @ODNIGov   Here's your covid keyphrase list, and "you turds" points to Sochaczew, poland, a brother with special needs, a sister that cares for him, and they signed hospital release. This all changes daily.  Now what's their motion in nautical miles? https://t.co/QNHP2ssVhK
@docsquiddy @cinderender I make some digital art.  I haven't tried selling it, but I thought a collection might make a great coffee table book to publish, &amp; that'd be different, than what you despise about NFT. https://t.co/HIAGIcdtYa

@Karma_Rx A lot of ppl pull the trigger, even in true self defense, yet don't realize the necessity of a great attorney, cause that shit can be flipped back on you.  Be careful @Karma_Rx
Screw their article.  A more accurate analysis, is Germany was occupied by Nazis too.  They rose to power through fraternal organizations, the order of Thule, theosophy circles tied to eugenics research, etc.  https://t.co/OKlifnrzUv

@thedailybeast @mattklewis Character attacks, in a world where politics are just game theory, is so Jerry Springer...   Attack the lack of results, it's anybody wants from ANY politician, &amp; attacking character?  really he said she said crap.
@BrookingsFP @gregorydjohnsen Children are forced to be prostitutes or child soldiers, to fuel the conflict in Yemen, meanwhile war profiteers, cashed in his many Christmases?
@ForeignAffairs Quit ruining the Mekong delta!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Republicans place domestic immigration policy reform, but circumvent the national defense strategy?
@POTUS Hey, that's the largest migration ever, from rural China, to factories. Destroying culture. When automation displaces those jobs = world's largest homelessness problem ever. Living conditions make Xinjiang camps look like the Plaza hotel.  Right?
@Karma_Rx I prefer when women "make out" with my balls, instead of trying to remove them via vacuum....we all have preferences...
@CIA How the field has changed since WWII.  You used to get killed if your shirt buttons were sewn western style vs European.  Where as now, everybody has a smartphone, and all those smartphones have software from all sorts of state &amp; non state actors...
@Karma_Rx You should take out a color print ad for your soap in a magazine.  This will give you some anonymity with your bz.  Magazines like People, &amp; Good Housekeeping, are probably not affordable.  But find a great magazine that is for you.

@brennasparksxxx I liked poloniex. I had like &amp; $15 worth of btc, that is worth like over a grand now in a poloniex account.  I like that you could do microloans on poloniex for a quick buck....
@Karma_Rx You should start a print mag, and sell your soap in it to subscribers.   Along with shitloads of ads...

@SecBlinken The belt may be the largest human migration in history, from farm 2 factory, but, automation displaces jobs, turning it into the worlds largest homelessness problem, which reinforces the living conditions of concentration camps.  If China exports that, it's problems..
@AmbJohnBolton Concentration camps are data driven.  It's orders if General tso's chicken or pork, &amp; the camps at the US border (pork) or Xinjiang (chicken) it's US restaurants, the data IS leftover change per order.  Change name of general tso= no camps.

@GenMhayden Hard? Didn't they still bow at the Novosibirsk train depot to I'd the CIA in the field, &amp; sit alongside the garage area for a while to let you know if they are dead.  Same as in 91?
