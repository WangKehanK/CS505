@blood_brat_ I feel middle aged

I love s8n @mschf x @LilNasX #satanshoes https://t.co/3aLlYZPyTD
Christians still getting offended over devil imagery? Lol
@tragically_ham_ Good luck!
All I want to do is play music with friends again :( I want to be in a band again
What can I do to advocate for mental health? My personal experience with the mental health system in the US has been terrible, and I can‚Äôt imagine how it must be for people that do not have my level of privilege. Are there any good resources I can share? #mentalhealth
Syracuse, get it together, I saw more people walking into restaurants without masks than with...
@smolpoppies yikes
@SpaceLiminalBot Not liminal for anyone who works night shift at a service job
Wheres the stimulus
British people just be talking over rock music nowadays
Oh also, happy birthday to the most underrated Radiohead record
Stopping in to say that Skyward Sword is underrated, and I'm glad it's going to be on the Switch. Just give it a try.
I hope Unknown Mortal Orchestra is still making music in 2141 so we can get "SB-129"
Major Goals for 2021: 1. Move to Canada and begin Grad School 2. Become proficient with Logic Pro X 3. Learn French  I guess you could call these my resolutions?
I forgot it
Being 21-24 right now is really weird because we got to experience a combination of 90s, 00s and 10s childhood/adolescence at the cost of having no real early 20s
don't forget this https://t.co/Vl6n7SLKHV
Tell me how SOPHIE was barely trending yesterday, but the death of a character from the Anime Attack on Titan has been on trending all day with Sophie just wiped from "what's happening"
I can‚Äôt even believe she‚Äôs dead still, like this can‚Äôt be real right?
@RStevieMoore Hope you lose followers for this one
@tinnkky Bad take
RIP Sophie. At a loss for words
First major release Friday of 2021 tomorrow.
@pxtel_N @IGN Yeah I literally don‚Äôt get it, it seems totally unwarranted too. Like what did this person do to you to warrant you dancing on her grave?
@conspiraboomers Does someone wanna plan a DND campaign on this boomer conspiracy map
@theneedledrop If you ate someone, would that make you a Cannibal Ox?
@XXL I listened to Ski Mask for 3 years until XXL told me I wasn‚Äôt actually a fan üò•
@taishamakainai1 @dandycandyfairy So retweet that tweet
How it be right now https://t.co/ECbojjjGPq
@dj_rozwell I sure hope so
Gonna be totally honest- so far, being 23 has been trash
@NOTrateyrmusic @MusicIsDumb This album is amazing
@smolpoppies I used to skateboard through UBs north campus listening to Treasure and Heaven or Las Vegas... the good days
@lordtaylorvb This is the dumbest app on the planet why do people care about this
One thing that happens to me a lot that shows me how addicted to technology I am is that I‚Äôll be listening to vinyl and check Spotify only to be confused when it‚Äôs not playing anything
@theconnorparty Me every day
@jennaMzesty What are they liking
@dysprotzanXdyke @NOTrateyrmusic @torusdrovenson Oh nice, amazing band
@dysprotzanXdyke @NOTrateyrmusic @torusdrovenson I see that it says indifference. I was just memeing  PS who is that a picture of ?
@NOTrateyrmusic @torusdrovenson Hate Your Music

@quirkyblackenby @understandud @wohamsx Here on Twitter we hate everyone when they do something kind of cringe, and then we never forgive them. AOC tweeted some obvious stuff about impeachment that got a lot of likes? We‚Äôre done with her. Who cares that she is among the most progressive people in the Government today!
@TXwoodworker98 @Arbitrarymagi @WNK_Life @elxalt @kindofabitcch @smdftbba @ProphetPedro @summmerose @Nyiko_D_Ndlovu @wohamsx Still doesn‚Äôt say handgun
@nicorunfast @PigsAndPlans Joined the discord, this seems pretty cool! I‚Äôll give some thoughts about it soon
@smolpoppies I‚Äôll let you know if I pursue the idea any further
@BrentonBlanchet @BenCBlanchet @nb_m_c Huh, I follow them on Instagram and could never figure out why
@smolpoppies It‚Äôs like a book club, but instead of discussing a book every meeting, you discuss an album!
Thinking of starting a virtual listening club after reading an article about it. Does anyone have one with open spots or have any interest in joining me?
@730t__ Dumbest replies in history under this tweet. Imagine making art, someone steals it and then a bunch of randoms are like ‚Äúyou should be grateful they stole. They like your art.‚Äù  Y‚Äôall ridiculous.
This year has been bad so far.
:‚Äô)
@BillyBO52785268 @CrookedCasper @Billy_Cage @morganisawizard @bemyownredeemer @YearsPastMatter @metalgearobama Nonsensical response
#billsmafia #GoBills
I'll admit I don't really watch the Bills but I am glued to the screen right now
@TianaHRR Have you ever heard of Everywhere at the End of Time?

@RenegadeTimes @JonathanFlora3 @the_moviebob Update she blocked me after saying nonsense
@RenegadeTimes @JonathanFlora3 @the_moviebob Alright here‚Äôs my source: https://t.co/0oXwa2MMga  It‚Äôs a vaccine. If you have any credible source that says it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôd love to see it. Otherwise don‚Äôt bother replying.
@RenegadeTimes @JonathanFlora3 @the_moviebob It‚Äôs literally a vaccine, just a different type
@RenegadeTimes @JonathanFlora3 @the_moviebob If all these crazy things are happening as a result of Covid, why don‚Äôt we get through vaccinations and cut it off at the source?
@RenegadeTimes @JonathanFlora3 @the_moviebob All this tells me is that we need to vaccinate quicker so we can get rid of all these issues too
@KevinWo27654037 @IGN Uhhh why are you wondering this
Yikes the new @DeadByBHVR UI in the test servers looks horrible! All the info I could have gotten instantly by looking at the bottom left side of the screen is now spread all over the place and a good portion of the top left is blocked by character portraits now. Gross!
To my local friends - does anyone remember that the strong museum in Rochester has a grocery store that teaches you how to become a cashier? Wasn‚Äôt even subtle
Been on hold for 10 minutes and considering sampling this hold song
@KnabeWolf @SpaceLiminalBot @ArtsyFoxo Was just thinking it looked like the library at my undergrad uni
Telling y‚Äôall now, the band Black Country, New Road is going to make waves this year
@tragically_ham_ My tik tok feed is just totally whacked out but maybe it‚Äôs a reflection of my sense of humor
@tragically_ham_ I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs less of a comedy app and more of an outlet for the traumas of Gen Z
