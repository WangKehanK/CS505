I can’t wait until I have a kid so I can completely demolish them at smash bros for learning and training purposes
@majornelson My favorite genre is TBRPG, Divinity original sins 2 is my all time favorite though #FreeCodeFridayContest
I think after listening to the halo and dragon ball episodes @20SidedStories is now one of my favorite podcasts!!

@jlopthi Me too :(
Is MySpace relevant again, who the fuck hacked my MySpace?
Look, I know Steve was added last DLC but still, dream character pic would definitely be master chief with a Halo combat evolved port on switch to follow. That’s my hopes and dreams, it’s all I’ve ever wanted in life.
My new year’s resolution is gonna be to learn how to talk to attractive ladies without getting nervous and fucking up conversation by suddenly not knowing how to talk ffs 😩
@majornelson #FreeCodeFridayContest I think the most  interesting would be the Satyr. They seem very strong and would scare me 10/10
I feel like I wasn’t popular in highschool but a lot of people knew who I was 🤔
@HeyBethMay 👀 https://t.co/5c3iasYijB

It was Minecraft Steve 😩😩😩
If I hear that the first FPS character Rep for smash bros is Tracer and not Master chief I will be very sad 😢
@MayaNpls Yeah, some people don’t deserve a platform! And good riddance to the people who unfollow and block 😤 They want free speech but do hypocritical BS!!!!
@MayaNpls Even so Racism shouldn’t involve the Political System anywhere in our society. There are some racist Republicans but sure enough there is racism in every area of the political spectrum and none of it should be tolerated either way.
@MayaNpls That’s such an ignorant way of living. Unfollow people you don’t agree with? The world is a better place with civil discussion without ruining a friendship!!!
@brookeluce2 😩 if y’all hit up the silver legacy they have a pretty cool digital roulette machine that you can bet dimes and dollars on! That shits like visual heroin 🤘

I want to blame Corona but I haven’t seen a girl my age in like 3 months 🙄
I feel like if my parents got me the Lots and Lots of Trains VCR set as a kid, my life would have been so different                                         *Clickity Clack Down the Track*
I practiced my guitar and ukulele so hard today my hands are on fire 😩😩😩
@InfinityWard Yo are you going to pay my Internet bill for this unexpected bug? I live in a small city with limited monthly downloads and this fiasco already took 1/3 the limit!
I been practicing ukulele and guitar and tried doing a little cover. Long road ahead but still a good start for me! 👍 https://t.co/XojL4r3Hlr
