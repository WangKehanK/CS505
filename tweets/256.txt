@mathyinthe818 @LHSLASD @CalabasasCarTP @CityMalibu @CityAgouraHills @thelocalmalibu @malibudailynews @acornnewspaper @TheMalibuTimes From Lost Hills station:  Toyota Prius and mid-size import trucks are the two biggest targets.  Also, standard sedans like Accords, Maxima’s.  The precious metals found in the Catalytic Converters are the main reason.  So, that makes ANY car a target, really.
@mathyinthe818 @LHSLASD @CalabasasCarTP @CityMalibu @CityAgouraHills @thelocalmalibu @malibudailynews @acornnewspaper @TheMalibuTimes That's a good question.  Let me find out for you.
A growing problem in Calabasas and elsewhere.  People ripping off catalytic converters.  See below. https://t.co/RhwRHCgk7X
