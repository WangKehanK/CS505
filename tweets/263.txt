@tbush_26 Because they’re little puppets. Type of people the believe everything they see and hear on tv and social media.
@oliverxfrancis Could you ever see yourself doing informational videos on FL studio or some sort of DAW? I personally think a lot of people would watch and listen. I know I sure as hell would.
@oliverxfrancis @Spotify My 2 favorite songs by you are glass house and chernobyl but toxic paradise is a new wave and I can for sure dig it. Great sound.
I tried
Today has been shitty. Looking forward to tomorrow.

@h7une I’m pretty sure there’s studies on how UV light from TV screens and computer monitors mess with your sleep and stuff even like the lights on your internet router lighting up in your room when you’re trying to sleep. Phones are probably a big one too but idk.

@gluquinhass @bmayfieId @Colts @dsleon45 Also not to mention brissett can throw the ball 5 times more accurately than Rivers can. Don’t even get me started on the amount of stupid things that came out of Philips “Hall of Fame.” Arm this year with one of the best if not the best O line on the league and Jonathan Taylor.
@gluquinhass @bmayfieId @Colts @dsleon45 Yeah let brissett play this year because we sure as hell aren’t getting Watson. We would’ve had the same record we had this year without Phillip to be honest. Brissett knew the playbook better and he’s got more respect from everyone in the organization. He’s been there longer.
@dylanduenass @1xYungDavy @CauseWereGuys Exactly my point.
@1xYungDavy @CauseWereGuys Because she probably gets the shit beat out of her behind closed doors.
@CashNasty Throw it into the stock market
@kiiiira Hey I’m glad you actually remembered that’s impressive. 😂 but trump won fair and square. The amount of fraud that went on this election is a shame to this country. I’m not gonna argue with you about it, there’s videos everywhere of people bringing in briefcases of ballots at 3am
