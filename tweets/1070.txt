@PaulTay60125796 @NeverwinterGame PC gets this first then console some time after. There's still no release date.
@HutchingsHannah 👀 https://t.co/fdW2kNXdyW
@tai_walker #SettlersOfCatan or if we're feeling ballsy/ promise not to murder each other afterwards.... #Monopoly. 😏
@EmSheDoesIt Well... I know for certain that Melvin Bird of Parsippany, his wife Tracey, and their kids are particularly excited about this deal to purchase customized jerseys on the cheap. It's a steal!
@DVillante2267 @EmSheDoesIt @BreakBallsPod I see the stakes for tonight's game have been raised... https://t.co/kJyR6fuKF2
@HutchingsHannah Fashion like 👇 https://t.co/7mrb7xo9fm
@HutchingsHannah They're embarrassing... This is the same team that filmed a pretend WS celebration in ST. 👇  https://t.co/znBeOjWPSE
Pupperz it's gon be ok! Promise! 🤗 https://t.co/b8pTWC6YC2
@DetroitSteel_ @thepocketgeek bro, who's dis architect? 😬 https://t.co/aTAZ8TfzKj
@realboshek Dellin will be back, it's just a right shoulder right impingement. You can treat this w/ physical therapy, meds( cortisone NSAIDs), &amp; rest. Let's check back on him in a month.  I know his injury history sucks but this isn't career ending, it's just the latest frustrating setback.
@brie_alyssa So does Mcdonalds but both can be delicious 🤷‍♂️
@kstanfield1976 @PaigeSpiranac Something, something [redacted] supremacy - how dare you!
@CantH0LDMe 💀💀💀
@HutchingsHannah Fine, they won by attempting a risky gambit that probably would fail more often than not! So why the hell are they celebrating like they won a playoff game? #lolMets 🙄
@brianbeutler @HutchingsHannah Hannah I didn't know you liked dark humor like this! I'm seeing a whole new side of you! 🤣🤣🤣
@greeetlamejor 🤣
@MikeMedvin Totally agree. Ump blew the call, and the #Mets stole a win w/ a gambit that probably fails any other time attempted. That's the beauty of baseball!
@stephanie_k09 How does a 🐼 taste? 🤔
@TLNewmanMTL Always could be a lot worse because human species seemingly loves nothing more than creating hold my beer/ challenge accepted moments. 😬
@Miss90s https://t.co/DWGp52fepK
@TLNewmanMTL If we can't stop people from getting infected in the first place, there's going to be a point where this virus will eventually evolve past all of our current countermeasures.   Every new variant discovered is a step closer towards that grim future.
So how does this get fixed? Shouldn't MLB force the #Marlins &amp; #Mets to resume the game from this point? https://t.co/9QCFsR6Ap0
@TLNewmanMTL I'd be curious to see what variant of the coronavirus this person was infected with.
@LoveTheRox I'm rooting for them to defy expectations

@thepocketgeek The application of liability to a manufacturer is a necessary restraint upon them lest they foist inherently faulty/ defective/ poorly designed products onto the marketplace because profit.  Why are gun makers special/ shielded?
@thepocketgeek As to a registry, why shouldn't we be able to trace directly where a gun came from if it's used in the commission of a crime?  In such cases somebody fucked up and prevented the firearm in question from getting into the hands of a bad guy, why wouldn't a registry help?
@thepocketgeek Of everything that Pres. Biden said today, I'd argue eliminating manufacturer liability would do the most towards eliminating gun violence. Second to that would be more stringent background checks.
@thepocketgeek All an Executive Order does is direct the administrative bodies charged w/ executing existing laws on the books how to proceed be it more/ less stringent.   There is no constitutional crisis.
@greeetlamejor Eres de PR? 🙄
@juanvante On this play, yes. Even w/ the bad throw, Bruce should be able to pick up his SS.   ON other dissimilar plays I reserve judgement on whether to defend or not.
@lenibriscoe Sometimes it's just faster to walk/ race the bus... 🤷‍♂️  Otherwise if I'm taking a bus it's because it'd be unreasonable (price to distance) for über, the subway doesn't directly go, and it's a little too far to walk.
What's more abominable than 🍍 on 🍕? I am glad you asked... 😈 https://t.co/hS646t5Mat
@HMF4EVER She is consistently the worse and I worry for Frankie!
@HMF4EVER As long as Debbie goes to jail, and Lip/ Tami get Frankie I can almost accept any ending...
@_BigSteve89 It only gets worse, past 35 they hit like https://t.co/TKjvam0GHT
@HMF4EVER Would also like to add that as someone who has literally been rooting for Frank's death since S1:E1, to see my wish possibly being granted by recent events.... I have to say it has me feeling conflicted.
@nyycentral_ These Seager rumors/ aspirations feel as realistic as that Manny's-coming-to-the-Bronx hype train from a few seasons ago.
@HMF4EVER If Fiona isn't back in a substantial way I'm going to be pissed.
@0fficialStacey Literally me during allergy season alternatively known as the "aboreal bukkake" hell masquerading as spring.
@AlannaCoca The deeper you go into extra innings the more brutal it gets thereby incentivizing teams to end things when they have the chance.
@lindseyadler Give him an actual 1B that doesn't have the reflexes/ coordination of a marble statue and you'll see the anxiety over errors evaporate.
Alternatively, and this is pure facetiousness but...  10th - no runner 11th - runner at 1B 12th - runner at 2B 13th - runner at 3B 14th - runners at 3B &amp; 2B 15th &amp; on - bases loaded... https://t.co/abv4YvGYJO
@JoezMcfLy This would be a HUGE improvement actually!  Consider how the NHL doesn't just jump to penalty shots after regulation ends in a tie, they play an OT to give both teams one final chance!   1-2 innings w/o artificially placing a runner on 2B would be the equivalent for baseball!
@greeetlamejor Me dan la vacuna en CVS mañana, pero solo necesito uno - es J &amp; J!
@thepocketgeek We could be so lucky!
@thepocketgeek https://t.co/o0psvpNeod
@realboshek Can Bruce be out there w/ him taking every throw?
@DVillante2267 Agreed! Also that question feels like it's inviting a hold my beer/ challenge accepted response from this team.
@DVillante2267 League average is being kind. I was really looking forward to see how much he had improved this year before that knee injury took him down.
@mikescudiero @DVillante2267 Ultimately if Gleybor is now worrying about having to be perfect on every play, because he knows he has no margin of error based on who's on the other side of his throws, it can only go downhill from here. 😬  90% of ⚾ is ½ mental &amp; this is what's holding him back. 😓
@DVillante2267 @mikescudiero I'm just pointing out that on a team everyone's supposed to pick each other up, and Gleyber isn't getting that help sometimes.   Even w/ some of his worst throws, I know they could be picked by an actual 1B and not some bat we have stashed there for lineup purposes. 🤷‍♂️
@Miss90s Smells like fodder for a brand new Montefiore commercial.
@thepocketgeek I've muted / unfollowed some of the worst offenders. I'm just expressing disappointment in some of the people I haven't done this with yet but I really truly genuinely adore.
@greeetlamejor He's going to play. Game time Friday would mean 2 days off. There's no way he can win, no answer given would satisfy the media much less preclude further ridiculously derivative questions.
@DVillante2267 @mikescudiero Let's not forget that Jeter had Tino at 1B - that was a huge security blanket! Show me the gold glove caliber 1B that Gleyber has had to throw to, aside from those rare times where DJ's over there? 🤷‍♂️
6 games into a new season and already the most vocal parts of the #yankees fan base are in a manufactured panic. 🙄 https://t.co/pRh08YqeJO
@VTrain612 I 👀 where your priorities are!
3rd time, not the charm...
#Yankees base runners are demonstrating excellent technique sliding at the home plate tonight!
Cue the Gleybersteria! 3... 2... 1... Go! #yankees
@jasmrios_ I know Jas, I know... Excuse me a sec 😭
@jasmrios_ It's probably why Tanaka left MLB for the NPB as they don't have his whack ass rule!
Fuck.... Extras... #yankees
@amber00827 I was sure you said he was cute at one point!
@JoeSantanello @sondraa Mo infamously always had a stretch in the season where he was shaky for maybe 10 days, but outside of that he was automatic &amp; inspired confidence.  Chapman, much like Mo's predecessor Wettland, always seems to make things more interesting than they have to be... 🤷‍♂️😬😬
@sondraa Same 😓
@amber00827 I thought you liked Wade! Lol!
@jasmrios_ That's literally the first time I've seen his bum ass, arms first slide into 1B actually work!
@amber00827 That's baseball Suzyn!
@PIayoffTanaka Time was when the Yankees would trot out a young RH RP whose inevitable sub-par performance would generate extreme agita in the fan base.  It's nice seeing how this team finally has capable arms! 👍
@Miss90s If you put them side by side it's like a before and after picture. 🤷‍♂️  Brett Gardner's bald dome is assuredly Frazier's inevitable future. 🤣
@xiggy89x It's a good choice and I love the obvious tie in with a certain former Yankee. 👍
@Miss90s https://t.co/JDHR85LB80
@xiggy89x How did y'all decide on Boomer as the name?
@xiggy89x THIS KID! 🙄  Poor Penny 🤣🤣🤣
@xiggy89x And OMG how did I forget about Penny?
@xiggy89x I figured he was some make of bulldog,  but given how he's a puppy it was hard to tell if he's an American or your classic English?  Words to the wise bulldogs are not the lazy caricatures people have been made to believe. This breed has a lot of zoom!
@xiggy89x What breed is this pupperz? Also how are Mickey and the other cats liking their new fren?   I apologize for the questions but I'd been away from Twitter for a month. 😓
@xiggy89x @navhazard88 Wait... You got a puppy????
@TalkinBaseball_ It's at Coors mothertrucking Field I want to see Judge!
@amber00827 Ya got 1!
@thepocketgeek Because you had to find it first and then dub it in? 🤷‍♂️
@CandiceLen Wouldn't Billie try to destroy one of these little guys if she saw it? 🤔
@SlenderSherbet @thepocketgeek these guys need a visit from that Capybara!
@xiggy89x You deserve ice cream! https://t.co/535H8gL9cT
@xiggy89x Busy 🐝 you are Sam!
@thepocketgeek I guess we found the one possible exception to "murder logs gonna murder" ?
@thepocketgeek @CAPYBARA_MAN @moorehn But jags, pumas, and anacondas view these little guys like an In-N-Out Burger. Why isn't this murder log doing its thing? 🤷‍♂️
@amber00827 Nice day to eat one!
@CAPYBARA_MAN @moorehn @thepocketgeek 👀 bottom row, far left pic. I'm like what you doing?
@amber00827 Teasing aside, I am happy you got one today!
@amber00827 What happened to wanting a plain vanilla cone? 🤣
@amber00827 🍦 🚛 sighted in my hood of Elmhurst!
@KimmyMonte Bruce Willis is a 👻
@blackrebirth52 The science is still out. There's not enough data yet to determine if the immunity conferred in fact fades to where any of us would require a booster shot several months after the initial dosage.
@gabbyhurlbut10 Can we not encourage Manfraud by artificially creating an opportunity for him to say "Hold my 🍺..." 😬😒😒
@thepocketgeek @VamosYankees Somewhere in that thread it's actually identified as a Komodo dragon. It's just a sub-species of murder log..
@VamosYankees @thepocketgeek murder logs? Aisle 7 next to the beer in the cold cases...
