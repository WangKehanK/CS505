I never fucked Wayne I never fucked drake oh my fuck man fuck drake
And let be honest this was more premonition than weird dream behavior. I totally would say fuck and god damn in front of some kids and lose my job
I thought I might become a teacher but then I had a dream where I couldn’t stop saying “fuck” and “god dammit” in front of some 3rd graders so maybe not
Snap benefits update; the card arrived today but it’s expired already :))))

Finally graduate with my degree that gets me... a declined job application at GAMESTOP because I don’t have enough experience???
I’m so fuckin tired of this shit lol. This time last year I was happy I finally got my credit score up to 680. This month my car gets repossessed and my score hit a new low; 440.
And you know what sucks? I can’t actually call and get an update or anything because my cell service is cut. I can’t get call backs for jobs I’ve applied to either, so the unemployed situation isn’t going to change anytime soon either I guess!
Y’all the EBT people “reissued” my card Feb 21st and it still hasn’t come, cancelling the one I had and leaving us with no way to buy groceries for almost a month now. We’ve been relying on the kindness of friends and family
Except rich people 🥰🥰🥰 https://t.co/Ya3Lutaovg
My new ideology revolves around the idea that there are enough pay pigs for everyone who wants one scarcity is artificial essentially
@swampmuse Noooo

andy never had one of those tube toy things that when u swung it around it went ‘awooooOOooOooOOoo" and i think that says a lot more about him than he thinks
U can always tell someone is high when they post and it’s just   “wrong answers only” and it’s a selfie, like what’s the question
Old people suck they’re so confident their spitting straight wisdom and facts like ok Randy I learnt this lesson from a video game where I killed God when I was 7 we are not the same
@pombandit 🥺🥺🥺 wtf please I can’t handle this rn
Oh you wanna tweet? Baby’s gonna tweet??? I’ll give you somethin to tweet about!!
@muddaub @BonusEruptus Grampa Andy always swore it was the golden raisins soaked in gin that relieved his arthritis pain. Gotta be Golden
@WAAYTV I think it’s manufactured outrage against an actual toy when the real outrage is millions of Americans without healthcare, waiting for their government to provide relief in a pandemic that has led to the deaths of HALF A MILLION people in this country.
No offense but I’m pretty sure all the girls who used these would call me the f slur for having better handwriting than them 🥴 https://t.co/t2rdXMIJdS

@John_Kass @chicagotribune Embarrassingly bad writing lol. Like a ramble quickly submitted to an undergraduate English professor.
@GrantCardone Glad your kids will be working class.
It’s not a hot take, this just a reminder for some people
Bonus points if you are a man and the person you’re posting is a woman
Posting pictures of people you don’t like and calling them ugly isn’t the dunk you think it is it’s just perpetuating western beauty standards without actually criticizing the thing you probably should, like the fact they’re racist or fascist for example
@MissOMara those are her lumps
@ChaseSupport I’m not spending my day in a fucking DM with a BANK over this shit. Fuck off straight to hell. I’d rather die than listen to your bullshit excuses for why I won’t be able to eat this week.
No warning at all, when we got the fees waived last month there was NO MENTION of the fact that it was temporary or a loan.
Chase bank “refunded “ my overdraft a month ago claiming to help us access the full amount of our stimulus. Today, they debited our account $150, instantly bringing the account negative, so that it will incur new overdrafts. @Chase thanks for nothing and for ruining my day, lol.
Mao was right :)))) https://t.co/qoJqK3yqbv
“Local Twitter” has nothing on “Your Actual Graduating class in Lakeland, FL™️ TikTok”

I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m trying to delete it
That weird movie with the people with assholes for mouths: “damn girl u shit with that mouth??? “
Like... it’s a bad take from... a nazbol what did u expect. Easiest publicity this person ever got lol
Left Twitter giving genuine attention to an account with “nazbol” in their handle is all u need to know about what constitutes clout chasing tbh
Me : have u considered letting ur phone charge  Person : I shouldn’t have to charge it twice a day!!!  Girl this isn’t a Nokia in 2004 this is literally a computer and you won’t let it stop streaming MUAs for your toddler!!
I had a lady once genuinely curse me out because her iPhone 6s battery would last an hour on a charge. Original battery, she’s lucky it even turned on! This was 2019!!!
Only thing I learned working tech support for apple is how entitled and... dumb ppl are about their iPhones. People would call in like “fix it! It’s broken!!” And their usage looks like non-stop cellular data Facebook use like... babey pls...
People use a 5yo phone with 5yo battery, a -consumable component- and complain about their 30 min battery life like apple is downloading battery demons into their phone “so they get a new one”
Sorry to do this but I’m going to *chokes back vomit* defend iPhones from people who are always like “when the new one comes out my iPhone 6 will stop working!!!”
@BarghestBlack Ah shit u already told haha rip
@BarghestBlack Cottonmouth!!! Scary to come across in the woods of north AL
@th3saddestangel @FatWiFi It’s giving internalized homophobia and racism 😌😌😌

broke: rich people can even spend all their hoarded wealth!  woke: the only use for that much money is to seize it and redistribute it!! bespoke: diamond encrusted Jeff Bezos
Make fun on Lil Uzi for encrusting his forehead w a diamond but realistically this is the only way rich ppl can do something material w their wealth
