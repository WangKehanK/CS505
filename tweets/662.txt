My mom sent Colleen and I to get bread and milk and we came back with bud light, Oberon, and two packs of trulys hahahaha
Today is one of those days where I get home from work and feel like I need to burn my scrubs
I just remembered that a while back I looked up songs with my name in it and the most popular one that popped up was about a girl named Laura WHO DIED.
The nurses I worked with today were honestly so amazing it made the 12 hours so much better ☺️
Season 8 of letterkenny is out. DAY. MADE.

No one has signed up for the position and now I’m in a black hole of Stevie wonder Christmas records https://t.co/GzGYHxNJZR
I literally ended last night sobered up HOW have I been nauseous all day????
Someone needs to slap me whenever I start looking up records on eBay I really don’t have the money to support this addiction
I could devour a warm batch of cinnamon rolls right now
@bridgwilliams Ooooh definitely noted I went to the one on Haggerty
@bridgwilliams Yes!!!! They had the other two kinds of season cereal but not count chocula 😭 I’m thinking of going to the other one tomorrow lol
I’ve been to four different stores looking for count chocula and still didn’t find it so needless to say I’m a little distraught today
Spot the difference  Oh wait… there isn’t one https://t.co/vrNrZZyvOC
No need to call me out like that https://t.co/54YFTs9jzg
My indie playlist is the most relaxing thing there’s a reason why I can’t listen to it when I drive
Thank you Snapchat for reminding me that one year ago today my car got booted while on my way to a funeral that my professor didn’t believe me about
I still haven’t forgiven the Claire’s worker who pierced my ears in 5th grade and said I have “oddly angled ears”
The irony of listening to 9 to 5 when I haven’t moved from my couch in an hour
My alcohol tolerance has taken a nose dive postgrad which is not the type of thing you want at the ripe age of 22
Get ya damn flu shots kids
LOVE IT WHEN MEN MAKE NOT SO SUBTLE COMMENTS TO EACH OTHER ABOUT ME IN A GROCERY STORE.
Ok but for real how does Scientology even exist??? Shit is nuts
I’ve officially raised $3,000 for St Jude and my heart is so happy ☺️🎗
@cindyxvink It’s truly horrible 😅 I’m glad you can relate
I take a screenshot any time I see a guy explicitly mention redheads on their profile or comment on my hair on dating apps and at this point I should just make a book of them
Disappointed at the results you’d still have to hold your poop-remnant phone up to your face after you get it back!!!! Not worth it!!!! https://t.co/g8rtrICUYI
Family debate of the night: if you dropped your phone in the toilet if a porta-potty, would you reach in to grab it?
I’m impatient https://t.co/7s7wjn1xwt
Currently watching the state game while dog watching in a house alone and if this is my life in the near future I would not be mad
My old roommate and I nominated each other for the Bachelor as a joke but honestly I would not be mad if I was called if Pilot Pete is the next one
New John Mayer song hell yeahhhhh
My brother and I were looking online at dogs at the humane society today and there’s a one eyed pit bull named Crouton but my dad said no 😭
My dad asked me why I’m wearing so much makeup today as if it isn’t the exact look I’ve been rocking everyday for the past 8 years
I told my dad he needs to be healthy so he can walk me down the aisle one day and his response was “I’m not going to live to 130” 🙃
I would give anything to be at the Jon Bellion concert right now 😭
Just saying I hate every fake friend that let me have cringey glasses for SO LONG as a tween
I’m staying at my uncles cottage up north in my own king bed and lemme tell ya this is LUXURY.
I’m completely incompetent when it comes to realistically packing a suitcase
I went to three different targets today alone I don’t need this https://t.co/RYwwR8SzBW
@nataliereneex3 I miss you so much this isn’t fair 💔
Cersei’s death was 10000% not as satisfying as it should’ve been. That bitch deserved the worst.
It sucks because today I moved away from my home for the past 4 years and now I’m 2 hours away from the best friends I’ve made in those years :(
I’m glad my body waited until after finals and graduation to get a stomach virus
WE ALL KNEW THAT SCENE IN THE CRYPTS WAS COMING.
@cindyxvink Ugh thank you Cindy!!! 💕👩🏻‍🦰
@jennaa_metcalf Ugh you’re too kind 😭😭❤️ thank you love!!!
@Karli_Pelaccio HOW ARE YOU THE SWEETEST HUMAN BEING ALIVE LIKE WHAT I LOVE YOU TOO
@tuttle1023 UGH THANK YOU LOVELY 😭❤️
I never take selfies (bc I hate the bad side of my face) but golden hour got me feeling good ☺️ https://t.co/2edMSpvTSI
I got tips on my nails like two weeks ago and now every time I type it’s all clackity and let me tell you it stresses me out

I started watching The Act and honestly it’s horrifying that shit like this happens.
