@myssissippi APRIL FOOLS DAY. WHY WOULD YOU ANNOUNCE IT TODAY?
This better be an April's fool joke
I'M SORRY WHAT? https://t.co/vA3sNzutl0
Soooo I paid 100 dollars along with 70 other people in my class and Pearson mylab is down? Cooool.
@PearsonSupport Ummmm I gave the assignment page 15 minutes to load and nothing loaded.
@bestby_farr Hard pass on that.
Ohhhhh my gosh @erinlimofficial THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW I WASN'T IMAGINING THE RIBBON GIRL. Thank you for real.
Soooo I firmly believe that moisturizer should not make my eye hurt as bad as it does right now
WE'RE DOING WHAT? https://t.co/DPkfrx5XxR
Sooooo you insist on printing hard copies, my name is on the pages because of that, and you're grading anonymously? I'm sorry what?
To every who said @KendallJenner was a colonizer because she decided to make a tequila. Is @ThomasRhett a colonizer too, or were just hating because she's a #kardashjenner
I'm up @kasie because thunderstorms decided to happen before any of my alarms went off.
Okay but um @RonJohnsonWI didn't you say a few weeks ago that the people who stormed the Capitol "fake trump supporters"? So shouldn't you have been scared?
I LOVE TO SEE IT. https://t.co/oeSnWSY4cG

I'm blaming @nicole_kenzie27 for stabbing my finger a year ago today https://t.co/b7hryuu0XF
The temp is supposed to 48 at 9 am tomorrow. That means MORNING RUNS ARE BACK

Oh noooo... https://t.co/dJ1HyLDopt
I'm officially waiting for @wojespn to tweet that Vucivic got traded after his announcement
Not to flex on @GOPLeader but I can recite green eggs and ham from memory. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I don't care what your keeper is doing, slide tackling in the last minute for a red card is not the answer.
Always welcome! https://t.co/BSOWIS8LpX
Okay but @kat_bolton_ could still be my president any day ‚ù§Ô∏è
@kat_bolton_ I was very close to home so it is all okay just very inconvenient üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Because of course my power steering died during midterms. Sorry @kat_bolton_ I will not be adopting a dog this week üòÇ
Spent time in the sun with my hopefully sga president @kat_bolton_ today also if you haven't voted for @UTChattanooga sga president you should.
Does this mean they can name names? https://t.co/NnazV1pW0a
Also shout out to my parents @myssissippi @TE38Stormer for letting me watch star wars a million times because I did not read anything for class this week because midterms and prior knowledge.
I have already turned my list in for my research project, my proposal has been turned in, and yesterday Georgia decided to make me reevaluate what I had chosen. https://t.co/0AmInlCSjf
We love a boss lady @SarahSpain https://t.co/AsuAMiFEFj
HECKLERS I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE BOSTON HECKLERS https://t.co/PZUaKPxxLk
My brain hurts, there are at least two people within 15 of me not wearing masks, one of them is chewing gum and it sounds like pop rocks, and I get to go home to my neighbors who don't walk they stomp. Is migraine rage a thing?
Amazing https://t.co/Cbml2R83rd
Also as someone who taught preschool I literally referred to them as potato heads anyway unless a specific thing was missing then it was "where's Mr. Potato heads hat, arm, eye?"
But we had a Mr and Mrs? https://t.co/HAVHid0jNz
BUT DID DENNIS RODMAN PLAY FOR THE MAVS? WHY DOES MARK HAVE A RODMAN JERSEY?
So I would like to know if we are done with @RonJohnsonWI because he's losing his mind in front of us and on television...
"I see the length" me checks length "178 pages"
Facts. https://t.co/CnJPYc69hN
I have some thoughts on @KendallJenner and her tequila. Mostly that she's not the only white person who owns a tequila company and we're not accusing anyone else of being a colonizer
Realizing that I missed my chance to write a paper using Hamilton https://t.co/a9i44EUsVU
Watching Hamilton because it's life
Hamilton is life ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è https://t.co/99V0NYz5kx
The answers were, France, guns and ships. Hamilton is an appropriate reaction.
Me about unmute to play guns and ships https://t.co/KsJgXD4lHP
Okay but where is this man?
When soccer is your first thought and AOC means Alex Oxlade Chamberlain not @AOC because politics comes after soccer.
@AdamHK @EPB_Chattanooga My wifi started working about 45 minutes ago?
Also @ErinBurnett or @DanaBashCNN said it best "crying for due process will bring you due process".
@marcorubio Yes please call us left wing Twitter. Because NO ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS EVERY THING THAT HAPPENED.  Unless you know and what to share?
Dear @EPB_Chattanooga can you please give us a time frame for having internet restored?
Okayyy but hear me out @HouseDemocrats CALL MORE OF THEM.
Me begging the @HouseDemocrats to call witnesses PLEASE
We played it 3 times today? THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.
I am not a @BernieSanders person, but my God he has really tried to get them to make their client angry üòÇ
If only JB decided to pay me for the full 3 days I didn't get to work. Not just the remainder of the day we left early. üôÑ
I'm also dying at @SRuhle facial expressions üòÇ
Same @SRuhle same.
This is a hard pass from me @theweeknd that was weird
@nicole_kenzie27 Ball is life. And all refs are trash.
What is that goodie?
I just want to know how Travis did that?
They to see drake on my TV now? Okayyy.
I love @DaveedDiggs that's all
"It's like open carry but a knife." https://t.co/WTrRKdalvL
Soooo my brain that learned to much about Georgia, has decided my topic will be about Georgia getting sued over voter issues. This has happened A LOT. https://t.co/etiJzizAMz
Me at the group me. Let people live and not procrastinate. https://t.co/CflkQePfnq
I've been #BOYCOTTPUBLIX because there are 3 grocery stores that cost less with 5 miles on the one close to my house. OOOOPPPPSSSSS
I 100% forgot that @kat_bolton_ and I follow each other but like I will keep tweeting about the dumb stuff üòÇüòÇ
She literally said we were listening to this stuff IN CLASS TOGETHER
@myssissippi Because the one they have still didn't do anything yesterday. üôÉ And I'm trying to flee.
Am I really trying to leave them without a runner? Yes. I am.
Update my jaw has been clenched for 6 hours. I have a migraine. And according to @Ollie_peachpop I can maybe cry because it's what we do.
I'm really not in the mood to be here anymore today üôÉ
@myssissippi Okay but like what body of water did I not know....
I do want to know which body of water I didn't know.
I'm sure it will be no surprise I got an  A on a geography quiz.
Soooo we're pretending that VP Harris didn't convict people and send them to these private prisons?
THE ABSOLUTE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME https://t.co/5uXJNg1VL0
Still not over this... https://t.co/fH7vLbBz47
@SarahSpain Does this man not know Bruce didn't want AB at all?
Dear gop senators who want to run for president, Conviction is in your own best interest. You can stop him from running again. Thanks, Everyone not scared of people who won't vote because trumps not an option.
"We don't have a lot of time left" Sir my stomach has left zoom and I am STARVING
Okay call me and my love of sheer and no curtains out that's cool.
One day I'm going take a picture of the chat for this class and I will allow you all to suffer from the insanity of my classmates.
