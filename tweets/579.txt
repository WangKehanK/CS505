@redbirdnerds I agree. Fans expect to much from players early in their careers. Especially Cardinal fans.
Good move. Using the tag is just unfair. https://t.co/Ez8V2Arfql
@redbirdnerds Agreed. Wish he would start over Bader to start the season. I like Bader but he has been given chances.  Thomas hasn't. Dude has lots of pop on his bat
Let's focus on holding cops accountable for their mistakes first. https://t.co/ndHKYHejsa
Sobonis or Young. https://t.co/gjZAOvtk2o
James Harden should of done what Barney Stinson on how I met your mother when he was looking for a new Club to go to. https://t.co/9hMEHNfhCn
Probably the greatest player to ever play the game. https://t.co/ToWr4b7wOU
Miami Pacers. https://t.co/P2arWZwQyq
@TitletownReign He won't get that much.
Imagine the Dolphins landing Aaron Jones and then end up getting Wilson. https://t.co/lF7vRkKFKJ
This is a very good and fast lineup. https://t.co/pcsZwAzrUT
Lmao. Luka is so fucking good.
If @Showtyme_33 can't be a Packer I want to see him on a really good young team like the Dophins.
Yall don't be shocked when the Suns make it to the Western Conference Finals.
Over Booker? Hell no. But again CP3 made it over Booker. https://t.co/3yxEFrpu9k
Hear me out. Soto will become the best baseball player in the league this season or next. Already super close. Favorite none Cardinal outside of Lindor.
Agree. I believe Pujols and Bonds are the 2  most feared hitters of all time. Albert Pujols is the reason I love baseball and the Cardinals to this day. https://t.co/NH5PT40Eix
@hes_verygood I just love his bat. He seems to always make solid contact and if he ever gets his chance and stays healthy I think he will prove he has a big time bat.
@hes_verygood Think we sleeping on him? We sleeping on Lane Thomas more.
JJ Watt won't be a Packer. Preston Smith will come back for cheaper.
Packers won and Bears lost with that Trade. Smith has out played him ever since. https://t.co/Vn42WcDCGm
Pujols has to retire a Cardinal right? Still arguable the greatest 10 year run in baseball history.
Durant is great but come on now. Lol. https://t.co/9tRe5a3YsX
One of the greatest to ever do it. https://t.co/2fu5xJNCK2
@Hashtag_Mike22 He must be a Bears fan.
@RTNBA Lavine no doubt.
I really hope this Nuggets team reaches their full potential.  Very fun team. https://t.co/orPD892Ljk
Has been for years. One if the most clutch players of this generation maybe ever. https://t.co/8HnatAd4Wh
@lindsay_rhodes @danorlovsky7 Think he meant Stafford. He will be an MVP candidate with the Rams.
How does Netflix get rid of The Office, then up the monthly charge.
So I walked into the living room and the first thing I see/hear is Michael Scott asking who would be the better boss a dog or a fish.  I love the office.
@IcyyKing_ Ehh MVS looks better then average. I think he breaks out next season. He seemed to stay consistent down the stretch and didn't drop many passes.
@CaesarPodcast @SpittinFactsSTL Facts. Remember Holiday and Berkman. That was a fun team.
@CaesarPodcast @SpittinFactsSTL Dejong imo is so close to being an MVP caliber player. This feels so much like a typical cards team. Great defense and great pitching with speed.
@CaesarPodcast @SpittinFactsSTL Some. Need to keep the Cardinals honest right. Lol. I love the mix of vets and young guys on this team.
@CaesarPodcast @SpittinFactsSTL Definitely. Takes so much pressure off some of the young guys and allow some to break out. Helps the Cardinals are in the worst division in baseball.
@CaesarPodcast @SpittinFactsSTL I think Thomas is the real deal. He just seems to barrel up the baseball easily. Cards have talent. But in baseball it's hard to put it all together in just your first season or 2.
@CaesarPodcast @SpittinFactsSTL Definitely. I'm not sure who will start Bader or Thomas. I really like both of them. Bader has had chances tho. But he does have really good pop. Bader is a lot like Wong. He puts so much pressure on himself to be really good and it took Wong a while but he made it.
@SpittinFactsSTL @CaesarPodcast I love Bader swing he just needs to recognize pitches faster and better.
@SamiOnTap My only thing is he wants a SB contender and I don't think the Browns or Steelers are contenders.
Top 3 back. https://t.co/6TT7CaVrby
This shows us that Brown is an All-Time Great. Adams has been heavily under rated until this season. https://t.co/P76jaapeqN
@JohnRedbird I can see TON having over 30 bombs!
@CardsConvo Thankfully but shit it's playing a damn all star team this season. I see the Cardinals making a move or two at some point during the season just to try and match up with them as well as they can.
@CardsConvo No doubt. The gab between the teams vary way to much. If you are in a small market it is so hard to rebuild
Take notes @NFL https://t.co/qK52NdaXFJ
@CardsConvo I don't think people realize how good the Cards are but how insane the Dodgers are. The team they have put together is so incredibly rare.
@CardsConvo Love him or hate him he played the game right.
@CardsConvo Good thing dreams come true. Remember Jeters last AB?
