@shawna_autumn @apickettxo @justinbieber It says “logistical production concerns” but idk wtf that means and why is it only Ohio and the others are on sale
@apickettxo @shawna_autumn @justinbieber SAME, I was refreshing until noon and saw it and was so upset. One of my friends had the pre-order code and we didn’t use it and now I’m glad we didn’t, I’m hoping they let us know when they go on sale so we can get good seats still
@shawna_autumn @justinbieber NO WAY that’s BS because people got pre-orders for both Ohio shows :( I’ll have to drive to Kentucky lol
@justinbieber why can we not buy tickets for Ohio
