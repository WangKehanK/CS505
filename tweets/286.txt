@Karl_Keeler So when do you go live?
I woke up and instantly saw @Karl_Keeler ‘s food review and gotta say. I wanna see an Indomie one
Finally partially employed 🥲
@fionally10 It probably is...
Also, the amount of corrupted politicians just disgust me along with the fact that they, with money and power aren’t willing to help the people but themselves or their own “kind”
It’s so weird that ever since the pandemic struck. My view of the world has changed dramatically. Filled with so much violence, hatred, and stupid people. Although I try to look forward towards 2021 and my own goals. It feels like the whole world is just f**ked...
@Allen_Colee @Karl_Keeler Honestly surprised the vaccine works considering it’s been “fast tracked”. But hey, long term effects tho
@juannechai Perfect ad innit?
@juannechai Ew basic
Normally I’d leave work for last minute. But is 3 days enough to nail an interview and presentation?
Literally the most toxic person
@Miranda17451999 @JustSunbect @BrookerTJustice @duckatali @DAwnmcnemar @familyunequal @realDonaldTrump People who still tweet about flu vs coronavirus, then saying “we’re all looking at the wrong data” really shows your nonexistent IQ... smh
Can’t wait to get a 🦔 🥺.
162k followers, 2k likes. Big oof Samantha Kayty. How much did you spend on followers?! 😂
If you only focus about the rioting and not the message and idea behind the riot, then you probably don’t know how it feels like. I don’t condone it, but it’s a cause and effect situation.
@leni_ahleni Oiiii you okay anot
@_theXchange @odesza @Karl_Keeler @paigedis !!! The yoga top!
@ronniengg Same
So how is Elon musk’s son gonna fill up his name on the form that requires legal name? 🤷🏻‍♂️

@Karl_Keeler @theXchange_tix @paigedis Tweet is unavailable! :(
@PMingjing I think the covid season made me less energetic to reply people 🙄
3 days on tea break and realize that I still Stone at things regardless.
@juannechai Engrand 100
Music while showering is a whole new level. Thanks @Karl_Keeler
Was about to turn up the shower knob to increase the speaker volume. Smh
@anina_faris “We may appear good, pious and knowledgeable on social media”. Sounds like a very familiar thread I just read about where a friend not only violated a friend in need’s trust but also tweeted for clout. Smh you’re disgusting.
@fionally10 Still think it’s a courteous thing to do
@PurpleDealer Well I was drunk
I’ll make sure I give all my homies the biggest and longest hug when I go for EDCLV and MN
@PurpleDealer It’s very you. I still did not forget when you asked me to text my mom and say that I miss her
The fact that Kim kardashian has the audacity to promote her products at a time like this tells a lot about how much she only cares about the money. 🐍
@ronniengg Bruh sameeeeeeeeeee
@TeamBandL Please! I’d gladly pay.
If this pandemic goes out of control I’m heading to Greenland. @NdemicCreations
Well I guess now I can really learn how to DJ and have a house party with my family
Damn... never would’ve imagined a pandemic occurring in my lifetime.
@ronniengg Just imagine the amount of people gonna get infected from traveling in busses :)
I live in a country where the government still have room to prioritize what air stewardess wear and matters of child marriage when a pandemic just started thriving our grounds. Amazing start to our backdoor government
Just kill me
@PMingjing Twitter should start handing it to the fbi for private investigations 🤷🏻‍♂️
Those clinical masks ain’t gonna protect you dummy
Just had an impromptu idea of buying different liquors for a home bar 😂
Should I... learn how to DJ?
Just realized the genre I listen to is called ninja
Lit me tf up. I’m actually going to EDC lmfao
