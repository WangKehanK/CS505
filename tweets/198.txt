What if that scar is from a pointy stick that you didn’t see in the woods while searching for a disc you threw way off the course like a dingus? https://t.co/iREro09jlO
Cooking is quite the adventure for me. Sometimes I cook things and it really slaps, sometimes I set off the fire alarm, and sometimes I cook a turkey that I thought was good until my mom told me to throw it away because I almost gave everyone food poisoning 🤷🏼‍♂️
Hey @ loveofmylife... this game of hide and seek has gotten out of hand. If you could come out already that’d be great thanks
@Like_The_Jar @UncWywee My Velcro boots had a Velcro strap on them. I think that’s what it’s referring too

Nothing like playing a round of laser tag with a bunch of children and being the only one leaving barely breathing with wobbly legs to make you realize you peaked a long time ago

Hey guys. So I just learned if a skunk has rabies, it cannot spread said rabies through its spray. That is all. I know you were all super worried about that.
To whoever put their chewed up gum on my car door handle:  1) why??? 2) your a biscuit head ass hoe 3) 👎🏼
I just finished my undergrad on Thursday, finished my co-op on Friday, don’t start my full time job until September and now I don’t know what to do. It’s been less than 24 hours since I’ve been done and I’m already bored. I have two full weeks of this
One of these days I’ll stop spending money as if I have an endless supply
@Like_The_Jar @boberts18 Their blue section is nearly the size of our entire flag
Nah cows are friends and then food. You expect me to let all that good meat go to waste? That would be straight up disrespectful to my gal Betsy https://t.co/V5IkvjimIe
How many geese do you think it would take to overtake you? Riley: 10 Mason: 10?! There’s no way you handle 9!!! #justcampfiretalks

In class: Mason: “Guess what I have in my pocket” Me: “A quarter?” Mason: *pulls an orange sweet pepper out of his pocket* Mason: *attempts to explain why there is a pepper in his pocket* Me: “There’s no good excuse for having a pepper in your pocket” Mason: “Actually I have two”
I’ve lived in Michigan my whole life but I still can’t believe that the weather can go from -7 degrees like it is right now to 38 degrees on Saturday or 50 degrees on Monday. Michigan you wild
Note to future self: you are no longer athletic enough or in good enough shape to go to skyzone for 2 hours. You will wake up feeling injured in multiple ways.
Sometimes life just feels like it’s going so well and nothing can tear you down. Then all of a sudden, you get home after being gone for 10 hours to find the chicken you put into your slow cooker for dinner never actually cooked and is as raw as when you put it in 🥺
Why are participation grades and attendance policies a thing in college?
Does Oakland train their IM refs by giving them a pamphlet, smacking them on ass, and saying “go get ‘em tiger”? Cause it sure feels like it
Book: “I went home and ate my string beans...” Lit prof: “What does this mean? What does say about his character?”  Just let the man eat his string beans in peace.

New favorite Friday night event: Tailgating in the parking lot of a concert but never going in. It’s totally free. Grill some dogs, drink some beer, play some corn hole. It’s a great time I promise. Definitely need more friends to go though. Females needed
@__jennalicious Zero Jenna. I own zero
This is all fun and games until you retweet because you are hungry and then get replies like “which Shrek movie are you from” or “who’s the 17 you have a crush on?” https://t.co/BdmpTZ4pfR
Maybe I just need to find a cute girl or something
