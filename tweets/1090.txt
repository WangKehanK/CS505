@MickColageo @JimmyMack66 Surprising, or maybe not..that most just don't get this. "The core is getting older" Yeah, it is, and look at the combined age of the d that they started with, and that's with a healthy Miller. They just aren't good enough on d to pay a ransom for a rental.
@TSNHockey That sucks.
@Left_Wing_Lock Hawks broadcast said Lankinen is starting. No idea if it's accurate.
@Bruinsf99223558 @dominictiano I agree, problem is, who trusts them to draft well. They need a real hockey trade, not a bandaid..unless the bandaid is dirt cheap.
@dominictiano I love how some people are blaming the injuries. Look at the D from day 1, when healthy. Sorry, that is not going to get it done, this year. I can understand hoping Kase stays healthy, etc. Hoping that D core was enough wasn't realistic.
@HockeyStatMiner B’s are playing like garbage.
@mirtle Sabre’s - Flyers
@TyAragao @NHLBruins That was a great night. Only my second B’s game, was hot as hell in there. And this is that puck. RIP. https://t.co/BMCh7mhrcb
@Fact Definitely thinking this over
@caroljsroth It’s tough to pass up on 25cent body parts
@shawnferris98 But “THE CORE IS GETTING OLDER”. They just aren’t that good. Just in that upper end of middle ground. They need a hockey trade, not an overpriced bandaid.
@Fact 😂
@slicked9778 @dafoomie Ah, thought it was a national game. I only have it on nbcsn in nj. Nesn blacked out here for this one.
@dafoomie Hope Tinordi is ok and let's all be thankful that Jack Edwards isn't doing this game.
@ConorRyan_93 Hope he is ok, definitely vulnerable..and definitely not a major.
@ConorRyan_93 That looked like one of last years weird playoff goals.
@NHL_Watcher They have the assets, just none that they would want to part with. Maybe Domi in Columbus, or as part of a much bigger deal for Forsberg.
@Josh_Khalfin Bring in Jagr to boost his confidence.
@Devo2189 @MarkLazerus 😂
@expomick I’m asking because I dont know if I’m missing something. I don’t see the logic of your post. Yes, the overall pool of teams is smaller so I guess it’s luck of the draw who’s in your division and if they suck or not.
@expomick Why can’t more than 1 team in the the division be horrible.
@jtbourne Now be consistent with this, or it means nothing.
@frank_seravalli He takes advantage of guys in vulnerable positions. Until the league, and his teammates address that, nothing will change. He doesn't have Marchand's top end, but they both do shit that you cringe at and isn't needed.
@JShannonhl Maybe that's why they did it.
@romidon @espnSteveLevy @imseanavery no
@Chasenpucks39 @NHLBruins I'm a Bruins fan, and will watch the opposing teams feed on direct tv every single time it's available. He is unlistenable.
@ConorRyan_93 Cassidy better be telling him to not even think about it now with it 3-0
@Josh_Khalfin Did not like losing him in that trade.
@MickColageo Johnson getting suspended only helps the rangers.
@FriedgeHNIC And plays 200 feet.
@emarinofsky Providence?
@Super70sSports And wall posters.
@MarkDivver Agreed. They are terrible.
@NHL_Watcher They aren’t winning with that goaltending.
@KatieJStrang Just let Spano run it. Great article btw.
@GoalieHistory @NHLBruins @BuffaloSabres That was a fun ride. He, they, just couldn’t beat the isles.
@DJNYCNY @HockeyStatMiner 😂
@thegoldenmuzzy If Debrusk doesn't get his head out of his ass for more than one game every two weeks, I can see the Bruins as a possibility. Also depends on how the young D fares the rest of the year.
@Razor5Hole Was a great article
@EricEngels @armdog Overall it’s a very valid point. At 5-1, it isn’t.
@WayToGoPaul Every once in awhile people can be civil. 98% of the time it's a shit show, obviously. Not just hockey, any subject on this place. It usually take 3 replies before any subject goes to shit lol
@WayToGoPaul I'll read news, the comments are a waste of time. Why bother.
@shawnferris98 At what
@EvolvingWild Habs are close
@WayToGoPaul Hmmm, the Avs...
@EricEngels @Sportsnet Is anyone still saying Claude can’t coach young players? 😂. Good for Julien, always a class act.
@DimFilipovic 😂 F no
@RebelEconProf https://t.co/hZ26IFi6lE
@MattBarnaby3636 0% chance
@BradyTrett Awesome
@Sellab_co23 Works well for flossing.
@TedStarkey Playoff crowd
@heysarahsweeney Today I was asked if I had showered for the zoom call. Looks in mirror and wonders if it was that much worse than the 289 others I hadn't for?
@MickColageo Yup. I would give up serious quality for that.
@MickColageo is Dubois a Bruin yet.
@caroljsroth Sheriff Woody
@GoalieHistory @LAKings Sinden is still smiling.
@NathanialLarkin @DimFilipovic He does what 99% of other players don't..very unpredictable, makes him hard to play against..and fun as hell to watch
@blaireerskine Chicklet agrees 🤪 https://t.co/chx1vlcp3t
@blaireerskine 😂
@DrGolfShirt Formula 306
@EvolvingWild Same
@I_am_PrisonMike @Fact When someone has a mouthful of wine at thanksgiving is a good spot.
@NPR @commonhealth Hmmm lol
@SiriusXMNHL @BuffaloSabres Tom Draper
@GoalieHistory @NHLBruins @Capitals For Pat Riggin. I remember that, “he catches with the wrong hand”
@TwitterSports Rick Middleton, Don Mattingly, Dan Marino, Brad Park, Cam Neely
@Fact They need to start swiping left
@TorontoStar RIP. I still have my jersey. https://t.co/5emQelTqZ1
