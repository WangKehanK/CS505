@MrBeastYT If I'm chosen I'll give half of it away to another person. I'll show proof too

So even tho I don't post often. Things are starting to turn around. I just accepted a job offer the other day (still waiting of paperwork to come) but it's relocating me and paying for my CDL. I'm super pumped but yet it's still a little scary. But from this point on life's good.
@JD_GH05T Model 680 is better tho 👌

@MrBeastYT @pulte It would be nice to be chosen. Could use some dental work. But whoever gets picked hopefully they either need the cash or will donate if they don't need it. Good luck everyone!

On a side note since I beat cancer and changed my diet and started working again I'm down a good amount of weight!! #changingforthebetter
Finally back after getting my information figured out from getting new phone. #newphone
@PapaMeags_69 Make this part of the merch drop 🔥🔥🔥
@PapaMeags_69 Lol if you read the whole bill, it's only for 6 months. So if the state takes to big of a hit from loss of tax revenue it won't be returning. But it's a step in the right direction tho because Juul is not cuul
@tayloralesia Well it's not a 2000's movie. But check our forever my girl.
@todderic_ All I can picture is David going there start recording and the first thing he says is... "What's up guys the next part of the video is sponsored by seat geek"😂😂
