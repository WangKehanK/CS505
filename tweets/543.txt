@CoryDorr13 You’re not the ugly friend
I’m so done with life
There only so much more a person can take before they break
I’m about to put everyone on the back burner
I hate that my bestfriend is having such a hard time during his deployment. 😭
@raaylenee What’s wrong ?
@828Plati You let you’re heart be open. Step out of you’re comfort zone
