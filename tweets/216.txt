its 8am and my sister calls me telling me she thinks she’s pregnant then screams APRIL MF FOOLS... like fuck off i almost had a heart attack
i don’t need anyone pretending they give a fuck about me
ain’t much out there to have feelings for
i just wanna cuddle &amp; cuddle &amp; cuddle
liam hemsworth in the last song... i can’t 🥺❤️
i sit at work all day with one airpod in listening to podcasts... i can't complain
every single time i let my guard down it just fucks me over
it's beautiful, it's bittersweet, you're like a broken home to me
i can’t get u off my mind
bike week in daytona is a wholeeeee different vibe... 10/10 recommend it

spiraling
feel by post malone and kehlani will never get old
i was just called half a snickers bar and i don’t really know how to respond...
i continuously make bad decisions and tell myself i’m NOT spiraling... 🤨
everything happens for a reason, even if you don’t know it
Rob Gronkowski is soooo sexy. that's it. that's the tweet.

i fell asleep listening to crime junkie podcasts... needless to say my dreams weren't so pleasant...🥴
nothing worth having comes easy
i get to watch my sister get sworn in as an attorney for the state of rhode island on thursday... so proud of that little spaz 🥺
i wish there was a life pause button so i could get a minute to catch my breath
