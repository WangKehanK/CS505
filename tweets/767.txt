@KaitlynShay_ And I still take my prenatals, my DR said it was fine
@KaitlynShay_ barley use heat or bleach !!! I never cut it, I haven’t cut it in over a year now. I have shears at home and when I see a piece of hair that looks bad at the end I’ll trim it off. Condition the fuck out of it &amp; don’t wash everyday.
