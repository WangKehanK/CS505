i’ve been struggling a lot with my weight gain, especially recently, but i’m realizing now that if eating regularly and healthily is making me gain weight, then i needed to gain weight, and there’s nothing wrong with that. i wanted to share this in case someone needed to hear it.
today i was complaining about how my pants don’t fit me because i gained more weight in ED recovery than i was before my huge relapse last year and my friend said “well isn’t that a good thing considering you weren’t exactly healthy before either” and it literally blew my mind.
