@PDPJ @Cardinals On opening day? That‚Äôs actually a good price. Yes, it‚Äôs sad. Price gouging if he ask me.
@NWSStLouis Usually try to plant around April 15 but seriously considered planting now but haven‚Äôt had time to plow the garden and now it‚Äôs going to rain. ü•≤

OK if you don‚Äôt know how to officiate a professional hockey game then you belong back in peewee hockey. @NHL done with it. Hire PROFESSIONAL refs PLEASE. @StLouisBlues
@StLouisBlues @Jkellyhockey @Panger40 @FSMidwest Again, why are the scores at the bottom of the screen? Very annoying. Blocking my view of the ice. Please put them back on top immediately! Thanks!

These cars that shut off when you come to a complete stop freak me out and crack me up at the same time. Just waiting for when starters go bad when you‚Äôre at a stoplight or in heavy stop and go traffic. Companies that make starters are going to be making big money in coming years
FUCK!!!
@chriskerber KEEP GOING you‚Äôre doing fine! @StLouisBlues
GOAL Ryan O‚ÄôReilly! @StLouisBlues https://t.co/Y2MVN1Qru8
