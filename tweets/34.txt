Love how dudes on the lowest-seed football team in a D3 league feel the need to prove their dominance by trying to fight everyone and their mother at a lowkey social gathering when they all get together. 🤷🏼‍♂️ fight your own battles or get over em my guys👍🏼

Can anyone tell me what just happened
@cidsavior Skinny scrawny ass
Wish I could express how thankful and happy I am for the friends and family that I have. I wouldn’t ask for anyone else to be there for me when shit happens. I love you all &amp; thank you for everything.
You helped a lot of people through your actions and way more with your words. Rest In Peace X. You’ll be missed by many😔
