I went all day thinking itâ€™s Monday ğŸ¥´ I really need some sleep
Itâ€™s never enough ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º
ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ when a guy blocks me bc I wonâ€™t send nudes ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ like sir I stated I have a boyfriend from the start https://t.co/Em7YUCFqtT
Once itâ€™s back some sort of normalcy Iâ€™m reminding my dad he owes me a trip on my own
I was at my happiest coming and going from Mexico as I pleased 4 years ago ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º also had zero stress and responsibilities
The fact that he asked if I would feel comfortable to help him find a Motherâ€™s Day gift for his mom ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º
Definitely my favorite conversations with him are about Marvel and DC ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°
Should I just skip my Monday appointment??
Really wish I could call so you can calm me down
Knocked out at 7 just to be up right now ğŸ¥ºğŸ™„
Iâ€™m trying to see something sooo ykwtd ğŸ‘€ğŸ˜… https://t.co/FpdZyEIREB
Yâ€™all this started the tears as I thought of my mom ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º https://t.co/oBncWHKiv8
Upset about him canceling for Saturday ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º
Barely having my first meal of the day
Who wants to finish sending the save the date and asking for the addresses for me ğŸ¥ºğŸ˜«
When I canâ€™t post about this quick trip since itâ€™s a surprise ğŸ¥º
