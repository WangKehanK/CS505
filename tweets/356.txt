Can the media stop micro managing these dogs!?? They're DOGS that were thrust into a whole new environment with a bunch of new people, it hasn't even been 3 months! Leave them alone. https://t.co/O53uez35rr

That is ... a little more than I was expecting. https://t.co/uUezuzXC3W
I love Cam. Interested to see how he does with a full offseason &amp; everything. Maybe this means we draft a QB? 🤔
Yay??
Listening to #Spaceman @nickjonas through for the first time @ 7am was a dangerous idea, struggling not to wake everyone up with my dance party 😅💃
Brady &amp; I enjoyed a beautiful day. Wish the weather would stay like this!! ☀️🐶❤ https://t.co/Ds8a4AtG8b
