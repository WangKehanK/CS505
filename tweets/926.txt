You nailed it Michelle if they really cared about public health tobacco cigarettes would have or should have been banned along time ago.   Profit and greed..  Vaping 12 years no issues with past two chest X-rays just taken this year.  Now letâ€™s compare that to a tobacco user LOL. https://t.co/W3ceRRYmSp
@jrivanob All people are created equal by God.Whatâ€™s been happening around our country is disgusting. People are destroying historical figures there no real justice in the end and uncalled for in my opinion.  People in todayâ€™s world donâ€™t condone what happened so long ago.All lives matter!
Same here my chest X-rays show clear lungs after 12 years of Vaping.  I doubt a tobacco smoker could say the same.  X-rays when I was a smoker the radiologist could clearly see that.  #vapingsaveslives https://t.co/w6bbusNfIp
@RobertoSussman Well I guess no more vacations in Mexico for me.  Ridiculous.

@nonnarB @GMA @NYSMom4Kiddos @paulafaris True c stores were carrying them way before JUUL hit the shelves.  Teens may experiment no matter what you tell them.  We as parents try to keep them on the right path. If the media keeps running coverage and Disney channel broadcasting weâ€™ll entice them. @Alan_Beard1 @POTUS

@Slayergrrl1374 @N_Zillatron @MassGovernor @CharlieBakerMA Do we have any real world proof that Vaping will cause a higher chance on contracting Coronavirus?
@pypsicle @dashvapes And why the US would broadcast anything about Vaping on the Disney Channel. There are very young children watching that channel.  @michelleminton @eJuicefairy @N_Zillatron @EllisSonellis @Alan_Beard1 @schmidci @ChaunceyGardner Now we have very young children writing letters.
@dashvapes This is utterly ridiculous.  Does this child even know what vaping is?
@Ivisi @Judgedguilty @VapingWithVic @ytcreators @TeamYouTube When thereâ€™s a will thereâ€™s a way.  Perhaps Vaping as a whole will use another platform.  I wonder if government is stepping in.
@Jeffward75 I donâ€™t think it will do well in the US either.  Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s a bit safer then cigarettes but   no where near as safe as ENDS.  I read the chemical list a while back on IQOS.. not so good but I donâ€™t have that link...
@CarolynSynychak @GrimmGreen Seems like the tax on Vape is much higher.  Only .10 per pack of cigarettes and .10 per ml thatâ€™s quite a difference.  Unless I read this wrong.
@Not4Kids1 @EdwardHubert4 If they keep publicizing it and running Anti vape adds on Disney channel that will just amplify the issue.

We already know ENDS is safer with solid scientific evidence for habitual smokers unable to quit using FDA approved methods. If politicians would work with each other they could come up with a positive solution for all.  @PHE_uk @POTUS @schmidci @loraknowsbest https://t.co/O6q8zhzfKh
@kiwi_kim88 @CASAAmedia Really shocked on this one.  Cannabis fine no Vape.
@celliottability @AxtoxthexO A balanced approach makes sense absolutely agree.  A total ban could cause a black market with more harm.
@loraknowsbest Iâ€™m shocked they would run anything about Vaping on the Disney channel.  It could backfire and impose curiosity.  Very young children watch that channel.
@DavidPForsyth @alli_vapes If Europe has approved you would think or hope no issues in this US..  As far as I know @PHE_uk has probably completed more testing and reliable real world scenarios.  @Alan_Beard1 @ChaunceyGardner
@XoBabbz @alli_vapes @Surgeon_General @RavensHome @DisneyChannel @ravensymone @JeromeAdamsMD This may not be a proper setting to cover Vaping aka ENDS.  There are very young children watching Disney channel. Parents may also be caught off guard.  Just my opinion.  @schmidci @staaacy1981 @ChaunceyGardner @Jeffward75 @IronVapin @loraknowsbest
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea to have the Disney channel broadcasting anything about Vaping. @michelleminton @Jeffward75 @loraknowsbest https://t.co/p3WIio01yK
@RONCOULTER E-Cigarettes Aka ENDS donâ€™t coat our lungs with tar.  Stain our house walls, stink up our clothes.  There are no snuffed out butts tossed on the streets. Many of us actually ween down on the nicotine and there are many who donâ€™t even use nicotine.
@ChaunceyGardner @staaacy1981 @ParentsvsVape I think we have much more to worry about in regards to toxic waste.  An overreach on a stale topic.  How many cigarette butts are tossed on the streets. @schmidci
@VapinGreek They shouldnâ€™t be showing this on the Disney channel.  Just my opinion.
