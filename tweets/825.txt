@bebepeachx @peta
Definitely saw this coming https://t.co/Ec3JnyRNto
This is real GOAT stuff https://t.co/7kdTY9Lwf2
Proud of y’all lil bro @BaylorMBB
Baylor is not playing any games whatsoever
Best handles in the league  https://t.co/9zX78Cp51T
@Bio2k_ One of the best YT jumpers I’ve seen lol
@KOT4Q Facts! He knew exactly what he was doing
@lillostvdos So proud of you brother
Prayers for DMX😢
Space Jam 2 looks incredible!!!  https://t.co/9yyJb5tDaH
Space Jam 2 trailer is a big W
@Koogs46 An L is an L
@NotJuluka This is our year
As a Bulls fan I think we gotta put Coby and Lauri back in the starting lineup. We get so much more productivity out of them that way, and Thad and Sato still do their thing off the bench
@TheHollywoodBud Just wait. We will be alright. Zach has been playing hurt and we are going through a really rough part of our schedule
@TruuuuuIsMyQB Oh so you just swimming in it huh
If you woke up this morning...  YOU WINNING!!!  Attack the day!
These mofos called Kanye “the ‘Closed On Sunday’ artist” 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/6iBfWrZ5Lv
It’s the Nets title to lose
This is the year for my White Sox!
Anthony Edwards is quickly becoming one of my favorite players🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/DcxrEnx3jV
@yxngcmeptb I mean shoot if we are having him come off the bench and aren’t going to resign him you are damn right, no reason to still have him, it’s not like we are winning a ring this season
Alright Billy Donavon I have liked your coaching thus far, but there is no reason that Daniel Theis and Lauri Markkanen should be getting the same amount of minutes.
Harden has been so incredible for the past 5 years that at this point he is underrated. Could have been the MVP each of the past 5 years https://t.co/cQa22bj7qm
TEXAS IS HEADED TO THE ELITE 8!!!
Drummond to the Lakers is huge
@AfroPig23 I got mine at HEB for free bro
@AfroPig23 Cap
@WillKolassa Thank you my guy!
@YourRAGEdepress Lol that means the word bro
Looks like we are starting a painting thread. Here is my second piece. Thoughts? https://t.co/XSkkUyPk9t
@TDPresentsYT Looks amazing bro!!!
@ItsShake4ndbake 🤣🤣🤣
Booooo https://t.co/yI4WxHuhjb
LaMarcus Aldridge in Miami is going to be a movie! https://t.co/lAKvlCIu9r
Imagine if we can pickup a nice PG in the buyout market like John Wall😍
Daniel Theis will be a nice backup center behind our new allstar center that we traded very little for!
Oh we fleeced them too, what a surprise https://t.co/IWTU6aspZ7
Another one for the Bulls https://t.co/BR8hF433xs
@ACTice01 Okay but who is going to sign there?
I can’t believe that Kelly Olynyk is the best player in a package for Victor Oladipo... the Heat really finessed the Rockets
Holy shit Houston got NOTHING https://t.co/RuZ4rlu5EB
The Raptors are wild for not trading Kyle Lowry
I think I just got traded to the Rockets
JIMMY, VIC, BAM! https://t.co/JjNYAx8uqh
@wojespn YESSSSIR!!!
OKAY https://t.co/s5QPhjtPnz
This is huge for the Mavs https://t.co/VJEFD9EB4w
It’s all good, we can always just sign Lonzo in the off-season if we want
@wojespn 😔😭
Love this for the Mavs https://t.co/v6nmZHFKsG
The Raptors are trading everybody but Kyle Lowry🤣 I know he’s next though
I’d rather have Lou Will than Rondo https://t.co/L2y9jYieee
George Hill to the 76ers pretty much takes them out of the Kyle Lowry sweepstakes huh?
Love this deal for the Nuggets https://t.co/5u1B5fqdOF
How we feeling about this? https://t.co/8UiuUMiqsZ
If the Nuggets get Aaron Gordon that would be a huge acquisition
@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium SHAMWOW
Couldn’t pass on🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/n0XoOkO9VS
😍😍😍 https://t.co/S53y0Z6Bql
Now the Magic have 2 bust centers from the same draft🤣🤣🤣
@mikekorz This is a great day brother
BULLS NATION WE BACK BABY!!! PLAYOFF BOUND FOR SURE!!! #BullsNation
WE JUST FLEECED THE MAGIC!!!!
LAVINE AND VUC!!!
@wojespn MY BULLS ABOUT TO BE ELITE
WOJ BOMB https://t.co/0buZnkaISj
I hope the Bulls are buyers
I don’t know how I feel about this https://t.co/6Nc2AXRTMj
@mikekorz @TheFlightMike This one hurts
Why would he tweet this? What a jerk https://t.co/l2cYt3kRRv
@easybreezylive Yesssir!!! Proud of you my guy!
Here is the final product https://t.co/HrI2izFvJk
My first time painting! https://t.co/CBuNk9RnKA
Do y’all drink tap water?
@dz_thechosen1 Yessssir!!!
@MarcusBePEEPIN Goat game
How awkward will it be if he doesn’t waive his no-trade clause. Also you know this trade is a result of his racist comments. https://t.co/uqfJolOidE
Stimmy hit😍
Have any of y’all ever been to a chiropractor? If so how was your experience?
That Cardi B and Meg performance was crazy
The One on Netflix is amazing, highly recommend
