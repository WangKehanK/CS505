I kinda kicked over a hornet's nest with this one. https://t.co/ne2GeSbnAj
@IYAOYAS07 @melissamiller33 The premise of "foot shortage" is that it's happening to more than just you.  That means the problem is more than just feeding yourself. You have to defend yourself and your food sources from hordes of starving people, and government, in all likelihood.
@IYAOYAS07 @melissamiller33 The other 330 million aren't going to just let you tend gardens in peace.  And when this happens, the government will be against you.
@FBI You sick bastards.
@tlrjan11 @melissamiller33 We'll see who's naive. https://t.co/UUVYvNFBgD
@melissamiller33 I've thought through this a bit.  If things really go to shit, the really well prepared can go maybe a month or two. That's all prepping buys you.  What you really need is a small army of fellow preppers. By "small' I mean 1,000 or so, or more.  Unfortunately, preppers = loners.
@melissamiller33 (a) Doubt if they can protect it. (b) Can't really provide all their needs for more than maybe a few weeks. (c) That's like 1% of everyone.
@jeremynewberger Please desist. You're giving Jews a bad name.
I'll take "No Shit" for $400, Alex. https://t.co/bJO8bw9II7
@melissamiller33 No. Nobody could.   And if the say they can, they're lying.
@GKII327 Listening to a game on the radio still lulls me into a state of normalcy.  A mini-Blue Pill.  I like these calm little moments before the storm. https://t.co/j0FNuPZNyA
@davidhogg111 You still selling pillows?
Baseball is kinda my blue pill (escape from Real World).  But if it lasts for more than 4 hours, pour some Jameson down my throat.
@Jules31415 "Don't call me Shirley." "Abbie someone." "The whole fucking bar." "I didn't get a harumph outta that guy." "Charlie don't surf!@" "Fuck you, asshole."
@albioncollege Stop saying it was "racist", when the whole thing was a hoax.  The racism is so fucking systemic that you have to fucking fake it. THAT's the story, fucknuts.
Here you go. CA at 1,516 COVID deaths per million, over all time. TX at 1,619. FL at 1,574.  Virus gonna virus. https://t.co/axdZo3mjkq
Your state's policy is one thing.  The other, bigger, things: (1) How strictly enforced, and (2) local laws and enforcement.
Ironically, in Pritzker's state of IL, hardly anyone makes you wear a mask, despite signs saying they're required.  Just across the river in the Republican state of Missouri, I got kicked out of 2 places (out of 2) for not wearing a mask. But in the anal St. Louis County.
@Oilfield_Rando Washington University in St. Louis?
@AK4WA @albioncollege They're acting like it was a racist act, when it was a hoax?  WTF?  The way the article is written, you can hardly figure it out.
@davidharsanyi Pretty sure he's Biff from Back to the Future. https://t.co/z6CHF0QTMw
@redsteeze @chrisbrow17 @LPTexas Thank goodness he's not one of those crazy Q conspirators.
@CharleyTakaya Here are 4 of the victims (not pixeled out). https://t.co/HIcNeJuHGC
@naomirwolf It's conflicted as all get-out.
@Timcast The photo shows one foot at one instant in time (out of 8+ minutes).  The picture is an artist's rendering. That is, it's made up.
@youngbiafra Maybe, but I don't care.  I want real fighters now, not analysts or compromisers.  Give me more @mtgreenee and @laurenboebert.  The civiltarians are just another wing of GOPe. Rid the party of them.
Blacks murder at rate about 8 times higher than whites.  The liberals' answer?  Tell them they're justified, because racism.  Result?  25% increase in murder rate in just one year.
This whole demonization of Proud Boys is some fucked up shit.  Trying to do the same with Oath Keepers.  They just have to push the phony 'white supremacist' shit, despite no evidence whatsoever. https://t.co/Sgd5y8nuec

@oldguy_steve @CharleyTakaya Which direction will the sun rise tomorrow?
COVID deaths per million for southern border states: CA: 1,516 AZ: 2,335 NM: 1,889 TX: 1,691  New Mexico is probably the most anal, regarding restrictions &amp; mandates. Also most sparsely populated.  Yet COVID deaths per capita higher than both CA and TX.  Virus gonna virus.
Since March 3 (to Apr 7), COVID deaths are down 65% in both states.  Almost as if government policy has nothing to do with it.  Virus gonna virus. https://t.co/N0CGmBnB6q
Neanderthal Texas, with no state restrictions for over a month, continues to defy the laws of Physics and Fauci. https://t.co/MPZiB3WX7H
@AC360 Does he get these numbers from peer-reviewed published papers? (That's what we're always forced to cite.)  Or does he just pull them out of his ass?
"Reavis was a former assistant special agent in charge of the St. Louis division of the DEA."  "arrested... on suspicion of domestic violence... was being held in the infirmary and “on watch” because he was detoxing from alcohol consumption"  Our DEA, led by a raging alcoholic. https://t.co/JBof18qAUv
@chelseahandler There's also video of a Capitol Hill cop shooting the unarmed, no-threat, Ashli Babbit dead.  For trespassing.  You gonna tweet about that?
What if... the commies figured out how to commie, but without having to kill tens of millions of us?  It would look kinda like...  NOW!
@W90404843 Practice Test:  Q. Who is at fault for everything bad in the world?  A. You.
"none of the 400 people who have been arrested for their involvement in the riot have been charged with sedition... The most serious charge that has been brought against a defendant in this incident has been assault"  Reminder: bicycle lock boy got probation. https://t.co/YI3ETAgz1M
@Cernovich Will it talk about him having cocktails while watching Che execute Cubans?

@julie_kelly2 That was totally obvious. But "homicide" can include "justifiable homicide".  That is the question.  Meanwhile, Chauvin.
@thehill @VP Right. All that oil we got from Korea and Vietnam.  Or Iraq, for that matter.  When all we needed to do was drill in the ocean, like Norway, and frack.
Why the fuck is the US Post Office subsidizing Amazon?
@naomirwolf There were definitely excess deaths from all causes. Like 600,000.  The question is how many were COVID.  I gotta think most of that 600K was COVID.  That does not say lockdowns, masks, etc. do any good. https://t.co/mvbyc2KbRm
@BoSnerdley "only"?
Deaths from all causes in February 2020 (mostly pre-COVID): 244,849.  February 2021 (middle of 3rd wave): 252,593. https://t.co/Fy4rvgUCTu  Yep. 3.2% higher. https://t.co/SatltnGZwi
See the 4th Wave and the effect of the Deadly Mutant Virus?  Squint real hard. https://t.co/XTJBTOIKnW
Less damage than Antifa, and easier to negotiate with. https://t.co/CiGF9vMW0G
@DailyCaller Call Sharon Stone.
To be ADA compliant, airline pilots with anxiety/ADHD/PTSD disorders will be allowed twice the time for take-offs and landings.  (They were already given 2X time on piloting tests.)
4 months later, still no other machines/ballots checked. https://t.co/3wJVWff1Zm

@ScottAdamsSays @oh_melodylane They're commies, Scott. The issue is never the issue.
@Doc_0 Pretend you are CBS: Answer those questions affirmatively, without evidence, and announce it to the world.
@OceanEyes50 Joe McCarthy was right. And they've had 68 years to grow since then.
@PekalaLaw @USRoute41 The 'Republican' incumbent lost to the 'Democrat' backed by Republicans.  Hypothesis: the incumbent turned down a Section 8 housing proposal. Developer is major moneybags &amp; donor.  New guy is black, BTW.
@ProjectLincoln @TuckerCarlson So? Do his clothes scare you or something?  Is this supposed to prove he did not just walk in? Because it doesn't.
The Obama/Holder consent decree, working like a charm. https://t.co/4cplGTpGCG
@NotSweetThing @crawfishaka That 1% includes all media you see on TV, movies and pop culture, and everything taught in K-16 education.  The commies marched through those institutions for a purpose.
Citizens of the People's Republic of California,  Dear Leader has graciously extended the lockdown only 70 more days.  This, of course, is contingent on conditions. Also, the mask mandate will stay in place, as common sense dictates.  All hail Dear Leader, our Path To Freedom.
@naomirwolf @sherylsandberg @TuckerCarlson @maddow @ACLU @BrianOSheaSPI @Leftylockdowns1 @benshapiro @SenSchumer Oh, there's a reason.
@brahmresnik How would an audit of votes already cast intimidate anyone other than the corrupt vote counters who screwed up the original count?
@PardesSeleh Vaccines or the Pill.
@Malcolm_fleX48 @JesseKellyDC You can bank on them being witless cowards.
