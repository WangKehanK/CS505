I know Ive been tweeting alot about my graphic designing, but I wouldnt nearly have the motivation I have right now if it wasnt for my amazing fiance. She really lights my world up, words cannot express how much I appreciate her. @kinleybrook_ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

@tconnors555 I recently started playing alot more rocket league and enjoy the hell out of it. Idk why I spent so much more time on CS.. When I originally played rocket leatue all I wanted to do was grind CS and I kinda regret it ngl
This past year I really spent alot of time outside and learned to grnuinely love abd appreciate the forestry around us. Watching everything come to fruition and back to life again is so beautiful during this time of year, wow.
@TrashedTaco @Snapchat @snapchatsupport holy shit. Reach out and email them or even contact local law enforcement tbh. Shit like that is too far, and im pretty sure theyll take action
Any support is appreciated. Finally getting some speedart out. https://t.co/AgVLvdD97D

In 2020 I wrote a list of goals and things I wanted to accomplish heading into 2021. I can say i'm on the right track and hitting the milestones I need to. Never give up on yourself.
@briannthegr8 swear mother fuckers doing the speed limit or sometimes even slower.
If anyone is interested in giving my design account a follow @MintzDesigns I'll post all finished products there and projects i've worked on! :)
I am so fucking proud of how far my designing has been coming. Practice and more time in photoshop really pays off. Really excited about the future and hopefully I can continue to grow and learn more and more. Extremely motivated!
The design grind doesn't stop! - https://t.co/zRhG9E4wcw

@GiraffeNeckMarc Yea, as an angels fan and a team that has signed him since the decline of his career, you mets don't want him back lol
I hope the dodgers just fluke the fuck out this year. This is the same reason i hate the fucking yankees
Alright rob shneider. good man https://t.co/RDt6Z5JuFn
I, and cannot express this enough, HATE the dodgers.
I am so fucking upset. The angels have needed a good starting ace for so long. So many years i've watched free agency come and pray we get our star guy. I just wanna see Trout get a ring man. https://t.co/fxBCrPLACq

I think I have an issue. I have nonstop been listening to every joe rogan podcast. I think this dude is the most level headed humble person ever. Really love how he processes information and translates it into wording. Smart man.

This looks like a dangerous conor again. This is gonna be a good fight to watch https://t.co/k8EUDY5Bls
I'd really like the Angels to get some more pitching. Perhaps Bauer signing soon please
Padres are gonna be a dangerous team next year.

@briannthegr8 CP3 Deserves a ring man. Him &amp; Kobe woulda fuckin had it too
No way someone tells me she didn't deserve to die? https://t.co/5KnXAlo2c1
What the fucks the purpose of a warranty if these idiots can't get shit right.
Lol, my dealership isn't going to like me. They "fixed" my AC awhile back when I took my truck in but i'm having g the SAME problems again. Morons didn't fix shit.
I will fucking vomit if the dodgers ever beat the angels in the world series https://t.co/B6HCgGQWlK
Big moves ahead.
I made a list of goals back in october for the upcoming year.  I'm gonna write them out today, and everyday I hope to stare at it and give it all i've got in accomplishing what I have written down.  I know I can achieve and accomplish anything i put my mind to.
@JosiahCSGO i mean you're not wrong but you didn't have to say it ü•∫
I'm tired of being somewhere where you're constantly treated like shit. You give your all and try and you're still being treated like shit every fucking day. It's so draining. 4 Years of nonstop negativity, being pushed down, and torn apart. I pray I find something else soon.
