I’m so sad https://t.co/00LDt0cT1H
@jiffy_peanuts Thank you that honestly would totally make sense too! And be so cool! But I’m going to download it rn! You’re awesome🧡
Okay I’m new into zodiacs but I just matched with someone that has the same moon and rising! I think that’s so cool, but also could that be a bad clash? Or does it not matter
@bombdotc0m Let us see🥺

So last week according to you I’m the “cute girl your talking to” and now that I’ve expressed that I was uncomfortable with some of your actions you want to say “well we’ve never met or FaceTimed so Yanno?” Fuck that
Haha I didn’t even last a day! I just texted her, I clearly can’t work through anything myself! https://t.co/zBknIjzJtK
When the fuck did I get so sad dude
I’m having a dilemma with the girl I’ve been talking to and I want to talk to my mom about it, but I’m also not ready to hear my mom disapprove of the situation
