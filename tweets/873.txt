I can’t wait to not wear masks as much as the next guy and as soon as I’m able to not wear one, I won’t. But i must say, they really aren’t so bad after all.  -Good for when it’s cold outside -Good when hiding facial expressions

For those mad at Nike, this has nothing to do with them.  This is another company that purchased 666 pairs of a normal Air Max 97 and made their own version to sell exclusively. In 2019 this same company made a Jesus version with Holy Water instead. Not everything is Nike’s fault https://t.co/yDsAaNHOoT https://t.co/4l4MBuO4WU

Drivers license isn’t a guilty pleasure. It’s a lifestyle.
@JimmysSeafood @Ravens What about Dazz Newsome? Bring them both?

Leaked source: the Patriots are in talks of signing former Madonna right guard Adam Davis. #NFLFreeAgency
I think the Steelers should keep Juju Smith-Schuster...  I love when my team has to play against a receiver who drops the ball in game-deciding situations, but makes cool Tik Toks
