@Nlowlight Why Louisiana?
@mtheythem Yes she is! Do you want her info?
@cfe4015 She is groovy as hell
Had a check in with my therapist and man, does she know how to ask the most simple questions to make a great impact. I‚Äôve been with her for two years and I‚Äôve come such a long way from who I was. It‚Äôs a constant journey of self improvement but I feel like a new person.
@sneakcheek This is actually nice lol

@theneedledrop Honestly it took me a while to ‚Äúget‚Äù Death Grips. But one day I was pissed and listened to Hustle Bones and it just clicked
@postylol That‚Äôs ok as long as you are having fun.
@12odriguez Got a $450 bonus at work. Used that money to plan a trip to Miami with friends to go to a music festival. Also gives me a goal to work on my body to look extra good
@12odriguez Yeah I ain‚Äôt about that negative accounts. I want to see W‚Äôs
God damn this lit up so many nostalgic parts of my brain. https://t.co/gPWvxJ9Efk
@stargxrrrl Smash Sisters is dope tho. Mostly because it‚Äôs a crew battle and is always fun to watch
@crustpunked Oh yeah it really helped.
@crustpunked Oh yeah. Had one of those that was so bad I went to therapy. Stuff gets messy when things aren‚Äôt clearly defined and feelings are hurt unnecessarily.
@crustpunked What‚Äôs a situationship
@SHADIC_ @_DADIC Say Goodnight Dadic or go 0-2 in your next offline bracket
@hiphopfrogs Yo after I saw you with wingman I tried it out and it‚Äôs nice with the upgrades. Love me some Devotion

@tiradactyI Can‚Äôt wait for the DK expansion.
@Dentissb I can see your bday
Finished The Sopranos yesterday and as good as it is, I can‚Äôt help to be somewhat underwhelmed. A fantastic cast but I felt like the last couple seasons were the opposite of rushed. Kind of meandering in terms of plot lines. RIP James Gandolfini. Very solid show 8/10
@KarnaTTN My optimistic hope is this leads to people that need medical assistance that propels us towards universal healthcare due to Covid side effects.

@EricJamesReal Lmaoo I don‚Äôt need to be pgr to have an opinion on who‚Äôs not on pgr. That‚Äôs a stupid way of thinking.
@EricJamesReal @DairBair64 No?
@AutomagicSSB https://t.co/Aekda1zfxa
@DairBair64 Nah I just think they suck. Character is also super favored in a lot of matchup charts yet one rep in top 50 pgr. They‚Äôre slacking
Character can do this but only got one rep in the top 50 PGR. Pika mains slacking https://t.co/LXcEd6QJfe
@kaitlancollins Lmao they  are applauding the bare minimum
@EEvisu Damn EE looking thin
After covid is over I‚Äôm gonna miss the sexual tension between the guy at Canes holding the card reader out and me trying to stick my card in.
@goofiiboi I‚Äôm a team player man. Can‚Äôt bringing down the team just because I want to live lol

@Ivan_Davila_21 @cahcd1 @theneedledrop Cardi B seems like the sequel to Kid A
@SparkJair Because they are the enemy so that makes them Marxist, socialist, communist
Happy Birthday @VapMarce You‚Äôre a shooting star only hitting the beginning of your trajectory. Keep it up.
@JAMA_SSB Good luck and I hope some of it is streamed.
@imbenstaudt Also this was his reaction https://t.co/E6N7mX9POH
@cfe4015 I agreed with the video but goddamn will I probably not ever watch any of his stuff again lol.
@HARAMBOY_SSB Well I think small churches are good for a community. Gives a sense of togetherness and can help people‚Äôs overall morale. But it‚Äôs when it starts getting to mega churches and whatnot that it gets ridiculous with the money pouring in.
@HARAMBOY_SSB Big Religion and the police
@HARAMBOY_SSB Lmao two of my least favorite things fighting https://t.co/VsWSa7ul00
@Nucleose @gloomgoblin @DairBair64
@DairBair64 Yeah after seeing the movie it really made miss movies that I grew up with. Like yeah it‚Äôs very old man of me to say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make them like they used to‚Äù but like outside of Marvel movies which needs multiple movies to get blockbusters with good writing are rare.
Godzilla v King Kong was alright. Idk why vs movies have to be so complicated to get them to fight. Did Kong really have to go to the center of the earth to find an axe? Which also had an energy source that they can download through WiFi to power up the real baddie.
