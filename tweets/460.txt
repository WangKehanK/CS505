@Jennicide @elonmusk Irresponsible? No irresponsible is not whistle blowing about this. The media wonâ€™t talk about it, no one will. The numbers are fake and everyone wonders why we have such high numbers in the USA. I had a professor look over this article, she said everything in it is true.
@TetyanaWrites @AOC Uh because we already get taxed to fuck why should we get more taxes??
@wef why did yâ€™all delete this tweet? You scared of people seeing your agenda? We do not need a one world government. #resist https://t.co/J3VMKF9tJo
@jameswill127 I saw you comment on a 14 yr old girls page propositioning her to be a sugar daddy. Fuckin pedo. Youâ€™ll rot in hell for that
@realDonaldTrump I have never seen them find and continue counting votes in key states like this. They stole this election from you dawg
@JoeBiden @katrinaaszabo Trump 2020
@JessHartman14 @DimeInAfrica @suziiiiim Just because a media post an article donâ€™t make it true
Do not book with @Airbnb @AirbnbHelp because in times of crisis when shit hits the fan you will not get help and they take no responsibility. Iâ€™m now on the hook for paying for a place on an island thatâ€™s completely shut down until the end of may. ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™
@Airbnb @AirbnbHelp I just want to know why I canâ€™t get a full refund two months in advance when I booked before March. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t understand how march 14- April 14 can get refunds but May trips canâ€™t? The airline advised me to cancel so thatâ€™s what I did.
@NicAndrews @Dangchick1 Why canâ€™t you talk to her? Itâ€™s okay to have differing views.
@lilslickrik I love it!!
@lopedope903 Indoctrination to slave away at a job every day
