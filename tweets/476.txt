@_Sierra03_ ITS A THING OK ITS A TREND
@_Sierra03_ You’re so extra
I have a transgender little sister and I’m telling y’all, she was born that way. She didn’t fucking choose to be miserable and cry all of the time because she feels like she’s stuck in the wrong body.
LMFAO at people who think being Transgender is a choice 😂 You’ve obviously never really KNOWN anyone transgender. Unfollow me if you disagree.
large margarita plsssss
And if love keeps giving me lemons  I’ll just mix ‘em in my drink 🍋
@_Sierra03_ You’re such a bitch lol
So I usually walk to work but this morning I decided to drive because I thought it was going to rain  Welp I just got home and realized MY CAR IS NOT HERE I (somehow) forgot I drove to work and LEFT IT THERE
I’m drunk @ 5:21 #happymonday
@_Sierra03_ I HATE YOU 😂
@_Sierra03_ Wow we are buds no more
@_Sierra03_ You’re right.... no one cares
@_Sierra03_ Preach 😒
I have made ALL of the wrong choices
Tonight I’m happy to be 23 &amp; to have my own place where I can drink a Truly and dance in my underwear #noshame #livingmybestlife 🤪🤩
Catch me @ Gustavos all weekend 🤩
@_Sierra03_ Guilty 😅😅😅
social media gives me chest pain these days
To whoever hit my mothers Pomeranian in Turners Station and left her:  the poor baby has to have her leg amputated 😔
@megthom15 I love his song “Falling” I listen to it constantly lol
What am I now? What if I’m someone I don’t want around?
So I’m not sure how I’ll feel about that later, but what’s done is done. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m super indecisive but I’m also super impulsive &amp; I know that’s confusing but what I’m trying to say is... I brought home a kitten
Miss my homie @_Sierra03_  somethin’ terrible 😢
@_Sierra03_ You sound so grown lol
@MeganNicolePayt Megan....
almost in tears thinking about how much I love my cat 🥺 she’s the best thing that’s mine
I miss summer 😭🥺 last summer was the best 🌞
@_Sierra03_ I’m crying 😂😭
Today at work has been insane. I need a drink.
Alright guys, we can create political awareness/express opinions &amp; beliefs without getting crappy with peoples mommas on Facebook. Let’s tone it down a bit. 😒
My boyfriend is hot &amp; I can’t wait to kiss his dumb hot face tonight.   That is all.
@BailieeElisee @hjameson1 RT to bailie’s no
My hair is about 2-3 inches too long. Someone (professional &amp; skilled) please cut it 🥴 it’s driving me insane
@hjameson1 I hate people 🤦🏼‍♀️
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  As long as old women sit and talk about old men
To everyone going to the Luke Combs concert tonight:   I hate you.
And “All Over Again” .. wow
Better Together // Luke Combs... damn
This dude came up to me in speedway &amp; asked me what my name was and if he could have my phone number or insta. I’m tired and just trying to get gas.. so I let him follow himself off of my phone so he would leave me alone. He’s a famous UK basketball player. Goodnight.
I will not marry a sissy boy who puts his hot sauce in the fridge. I will marry a MAN who puts his hot sauce in the cabinet.
&amp; damn it this feels too right It’s just like deja vu  Me standin’ here with you
I am 99.9% positive that someone breaks into my apartment and messes with my stuff while I’m gone.   Needless to say I will be getting a gun &amp; a camera to sit out to catch this fool. At this moment in time all I have to protect myself is a butter knife. Lol
@Fresh_09 @abbylayne28 @MeganNicolePayt 😂
Labor Day fun 🌞 https://t.co/SF9KmBSE6E

I’m honestly not 100% convinced that these guys aren’t sending themselves these “anonymous messages” pretending to be a girl talking about, “I’m crushing on you so hard. Always have”.. “you’re so hot” and their like “riggghhhhttt I bet 🙄 but slide up though” whatever lmao
Deep fried Oreos on my mind.. 🤤
In her defense she didn’t know he was engaged lol. But still.. how sad is it that my mom is out here trying to pull men for me 😂
My mother tried to SET ME UP with an engaged man tonight hahahaha. She said, “I’m just really sad you’re alone and don’t have anyone to date” LMAO &amp; the worst part is... I know the person she tried to set me up with.. &amp; his finance!! This woman y’all.. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Update: this pretty little mess had a great first day 💖 https://t.co/7sVVZXBepw
Look how perfect they are 😭😍😭 https://t.co/joSiCxeZXZ
I’m not a crier.. but yeah, I totally sobbed this morning bc I couldn’t be there to send my baby sister off to her first day of Kindergarten. She’s so anxious and shy, &amp; I just wanted to hug her &amp; tell her to be kind and brave 😭 ugh why am I such a mom
@MeganNicolePayt @ftyler42 Glad you have this meg.... you bitch lol
My ~almost~ 17 yr old little sister is dating &amp; let me just tell y’all... I am tired. Lol. This girl has me mentally and emotionally DRAINED 🥴
@chey_riddle You’re not wrong baby 😉
It’s alright though, 6 of my brothers are blue-eyed. Just consider me one of the guys🔹🔷🔹
All the women in my family have brown eyes, except for me... let me remind you that I have 6 sisters lol... all of them (including my mother) have brown eyes. I mean, they’re perfect, but like, wow. Why do I have to be the one singled out?
sooo excited for the lake with my girlies next weekend 🤩
If my man doesn’t come home with dirty torn up hands after a long day of work... I don’t want him
PATIENTLY waiting for the love of my life to appear. HELLO where are you?? Baby is lonely!!
I miss my cat. Can I go home?

@Haleymiles1212 yessssss you right
my biggest regret is allowing an unhealthy man to completely destroy me because I was so in love with him
@MeganNicolePayt It really is 😂 life has kicked me in the ass lately lol. &amp; you’ll never guess which one of our favorite NP’s just snapped me 😂😭😂
@MeganNicolePayt YES 😩 it’s been way too long. We should never go this long with being apart.. it’s not healthy. Lol 😘
