@iIovedd69 Everytime I'm lulled into a false sense of security I see you tweet something like this. You are my sleep paralysis demon.... and yet it makes me laugh so hard it hurts https://t.co/sZuV1Zcerc

@fragileblkrose Being a legend
@awriimaws Oh no, oh no honey
It meaning the "Nice Boat" meme
So I spent too much time on this, the worst image I've ever made. I've brought it back. https://t.co/U2af5FIHg6
@wolxnpc Oh thank god
@wolxnpc The turtle or the President of Nintendo?
@MissAndyDandy Hell yeah hell yeah, good shit!
@Riocakes One day....one day 😔😔😔
@Riocakes Hell yeah, love to see Mizutama Honey Boy! Would love it if it got an anime adaptation, so many more people should know about it.
TTGL is at its core a show about belief, not in a higher power or gods, rather about belief in your friends, the bonds between you, and most importantly; belief in yourself. It is the strength that you never knew you had that lets you break past limits you never knew you had.
You need to watch Gurren. Look past the  surface, past the people who call it a dumb powercreep fantasy, look past all that and you will assuredly find what made me into the best parts of myself. I'm talking about a series that has made an impact that echoes still today
So, anyway...watch the absolute masterpiece that is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Without that show it is 100% accurate to say Studio Trigger would not exist. If you are/ever have been a fan of KLK, Little Witch Academia, Promare, or any of the other iconic works Trigger has made,
Lrt....GURREN COPYRIGHT RENEWED?!?!
I lay on the floor, and go to sleep forever
I swear, every time I have to make a biggish drive or take a trip I end up wired with dry mouth. What, am I an informant on basic cable? What's next, is Ice-T gonna cradle me as I die bc the gang found me out?  #HireMeDickWolf
@MissAndyDandy TTGL&gt; Believe in the best version of yourself. You are them.
Lrt is me
Yes I did it and made myself sad. No I don't recommend it. https://t.co/wmMBSJqFyC
Top 10 activities that hit way harder when you love someone  1-10:  Rewatching any of the Ellie scenes in "Up", especially the "Stuff I'm going to do" scene.

@AfterJuneTea Ulterior motive: make friemb
People be looking at my ewfie and taking frantic notes like "oh she said one word to this person, must be unfaithfulness". Lmao c'mon ain't nobody else who has that "I'm Drew" energy, nobody else has my magnetism towards her lol
Lol ok  *𝒂𝒏𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒔𝒑𝒂𝒓𝒌𝒍𝒆 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒔* ✨N-nani?!✨ I just entered @theyetee Anime, Gaming, and Chill giveaway to win a two Nintendo Switch Lites, two e-shop gift cards, AND a special edition of My Love Story! You can enter here: https://t.co/v0EgSCluOg via @theyetee
"Sir, you can't bust into the zoo and compliments the animals"  Buddy I survive off 70 Energy Drinks,  unpopped popcorn kernels, and 12 minutes of sleep.  I can literally do whatever I want. The laws of man cannot restrain cataclysm
Fuck it, I am back here and I *will* decimate anyone who acts too funky. Make no mistake my life goes on, but I'm a light sleeper with Bigfoot strength. I will go full sasquatch.
Okay one more fucking thing. Imagine walking up to someone's partner with a fucking pamphlet about them being fucking manipulated by someone and being like "sorry bro" you can't bc they won't do it when they can't hide on the internet. And if they did I'd knock them TF out.
I will fucking end them.
Now? I am livid. I was aware that she had been manipulated and made to send/say things she didn't believe and didn't want to say. What I didn't know was what the actual words were. I can safely say that should anyone else try to leverage me and destroy my relationship again?
Hey folks, so friendly reminder...  Don't try and destroy my relationship because you're mad that my fiancee called you out on your shit. Literally what kind of sociopathic behavior is that? I am not someone who gets angry easily, frustrated certainly, but not angry.
@AfterJuneTea Oh how I love that they then sent me a doc, wherein I then saw images of what my partner was pressured into, and presented like a "gotcha". Truly this is ideal,oh wait no. Also, imagine thinking that I haven't been told what's happened by my partner.
My roommate asked me if I wanted to show off his shanty talents to my friends. I said hell yeah. So here he is doing "Leave Her, Johnny" https://t.co/5XZMxGsPAc
Hey everyone I know I've been pretty radio silent but here's a pic I posted on my Ffxiv account https://t.co/WKqugnj0Ql
