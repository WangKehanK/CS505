idk man it’s just so cool that taylor is also still singing along to these songs so many years later and she knows how much these albums mean to us and how they shaped our lives and idk man it’s just really cool she really does love us
how the hell am I gonna live through forever and always (piano version) (Taylor’s version)
no like, fearless changed my life 13 years ago. no joke it literally shaped me as a person and to be listening to it right now... brand new in this way.... phew 🥲

downing fireball shots tonight like I’m in college again
@milfspits Wow. This is so Punjabi I love it
@milfspits You have DAIRY TOLERANCE? As an ASIAN? You’re so powerful
@hannahzwk it’s called manifesting
@fictionalmissp the dream ... fr
@fictionalmissp this is a great idea. I might need a California king
@lucyj_ford I KNOW SAME
@hoe_doyan Wow just two ppl with great playlists and lower taxes? love this concept
@hoe_doyan is this a proposal? are we getting married?
I’ll be having my own room thanks. Anybody who agrees, I’m single n ready for marriage
this isn’t a new take whatsoever but it absolutely baffles me that married ppl/ppl in a relationship are meant to SHARE A BED... BRO.... absolutely not. That’s not happening for me. it’s just not. I refuse to do it.
not to be dramatic but my sprouting basil  plant is the only thing I currently have going for me https://t.co/wMVCOtVVo6
@wayvlays in a parallel universe, you’re married to him

@sara_del 💛
@nazaramulet I think I should be ok tomorrow!! Usually symptoms go away p quickly
That second dose is currently making me feel like I got bit by a poisonous rat. I’m suffering
just thought of the implications of having a brand new shiny fearless era song in my hands in 25 hours
@gayofbengal Exactly
@gayofbengal when I told u I lived in toledo and u said “no that’s a made up place in riverdale”
everyone has come to the realization that they all have a friend from ohio but when did u realize that YOU’RE the token friend from ohio
