@PersistOhio @Ohioans4C @Ted_Strickland And I worked for the ODP in 2016 and they cut funding to Ted’s campaign in the summer so that’s another thing you need to remember.
@Ohioans4C @PersistOhio @Ted_Strickland Unfortunately Ted ran as a moderate. Plus you’re completely forgetting that 2016 was a Republican wave year
I’m a full blown socialist and even I think @ProudSocialist has lost his mind.
@PersistOhio @ConnieSchultz  but @johnlegend is a close second
