@vornyonmain1 @VVMilotic Sadly that's not a real game mechanic, otherwise all 3 of us would be doing it. Well, VV's case would be coil checking since she doesn't have hips. You get the idea.
@vornyonmain1 @VVMilotic I main heavy bowgun. I'm not good at reading monsters so I rely on stamina buffs and the bowguns inbuilt shield to tank most of it. I'm a pretty good shot and while it might not look like I'm doing much, my piercing rounds do a lot of breaks~
@VVMilotic You would main a hammer, big girl~
@SheriffZard Said the ass. :3c
@Mawnstrous The fact that I can sit on and crush them with my fat ass. Girl I do what I want.
@Mawnstrous CORRIE
@RedEquine @Bloo_Muen https://t.co/t7TOAV8akc
@ThatDumbDragon I heard there were shenanigans.
@aliembruh *menacingly brandishes wallet*
@Bloo_Muen I could eat prey for every meal of the day, or just nonstop forever.
@ShioMWad @RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 It's more common than you might think.
@RealDragonGirl 2nd one is always worse.
@RealDragonGirl Have a fun next few days!
Holy shit everyone is getting vaccinated today.
@KaffeineKaiju Mysteries Unsolved with Proper Grammar: How do you make lineart look stiff but lccleanean up a sketch?  (you did a double negative)
@F_for_Frostie @YouTube WHAT THE HECK THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMG
@heavysetkobold @graros_ Duh. Grar fits in just about everyone.
@F_for_Frostie @YouTube You would have a song called Pears playing.
@Roselyn233 I've got my eyes on you...
@Roselyn233 https://t.co/qeGFJe479X
@Mawnstrous Do it. You won't.
Just one half of the work day left and then I don't have to do anything until after @GryphonJeriko gets here for a week long visit. ðŸ˜«
@propriospace Circles are scientifically proven to be aesthetically pleasing and reduce stress and anxiety levels.
@FoxcatAD foxcat too fat, pole broke~
@Paradise_pup @DoughyDoe @DesiPubby23 ðŸ‘€
@VVMilotic All mortal possessions are now snek pudge.
@DoughyDoe fortunately clean girl (you) is plenty big as well and can put out enough suds to cover a whole island in a meters thick layer of foam.
@VVMilotic me @ u https://t.co/wl3JdrolEH
@GiramfeCentral well see now I can't because you're expecting something to happen. I must strike when you least expect it and more importantly when you're not active on Twitter so you don't immediately notice. :3c
@Argaront1 @RenTradewind the most friend shaped manadragon of all~
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame WAIT YOU'RE THE ARCHDEMON OF GLUTTONY?  I'M THE ELDER GODDESS OF GLUTTONY!!!  WE WERE MEANT TO BE FRIENDS YOU'RE ONE OF MY COMMANDING OFFICERS!!! https://t.co/73jILsZBtW
@RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 That firetype joke went up in smoke.
@GiramfeCentral must resist urge to mess with...
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame Not so much an ass person myself but I will be sure to give plenty of tum rubs while digesting and well after she's added to it~
@RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 Don't be such a big target then.  GOTTER
@RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 And that's what makes you such a good meal! When we eat you, we know we're getting several dozen prey for the price of one, especially with your love of sentient fat. â™¥
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame IKR? She acts like this big dommy Ninetales queen but really she's this adorable butterball pushover~
@RenTradewind HELLO BALTIMOH, DO YOU LIKE CRAFF?
@derFisch Imagine how much more friend shaped you'd be if you did. :'c
@RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 That's fine. Unwilling is hotter than willing anyway. They put up more of a struggle and give better internal massages. I'm sure they'll appreciate your unwillingness.
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame As long as you're implying she's edible and not me, but yeah I'll gladly yeet her down that pretty cat's gullet.
@carbontrap what is this fat round little cutie btw and where do I get one?
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame idk, that one looks kinda thin. ðŸ¤”
@RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 I am and forever will be a hub of social interaction because I don't let myself get tied into cliques so I bridge the gap and a lot of different people meet through me.  They are all fat and/or vorny though.
@carbontrap YOU HAVE NO IDEA how much it means to me that someone so talented wants to draw my sona. I'm literally tearing up that is one of the best compliments I've ever gotten. Finding great illustrators who appreciate bigger body types is so hard. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.â™¥ https://t.co/KMRq5zyfdr
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame I see no problem with this?
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame *poses* https://t.co/vlumZoO58J
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame There is no such thing as abnormally large. It's not her fault the rest of the world is oddly small.
@RakugaKite I'M TWEETING AT YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T FOLLOW AND I CAN'T REPLY :C  To a buffet, obviously. A normal restaurant would bankrupt me. :3c
@RealEmberflame @vornyonmain1 hello friend of Ember whom also likes the fats, I too like the fats.
@carbontrap I'm blessed such a talented individual follows a big fat noodle like me, you're the wonderful one. â™¥ Still interested in commissioning sometime, don't forget me!
*sees coils* ðŸ‘Œ  *clicks pic, sees human upper half* ðŸ›‘
@vornyonmain1 @RealEmberflame Good. It's impossible to get up such a fat fox once she's down anyway. Challenging just to squeeze in that much fat, but getting it back up? Nah, ain't happenin.
@carbontrap OK I THOUGHT YOU WERE SERIOUS FROWNYFACE BEFORE WEH also hello again!!! I didn't recognize you since it's been so long. YOU'RE STILL AMAZING ;w;
@aliembruh woah I know you!!! We hang out in VRC!
@carbontrap @FluffMawnster Just looking at your stuff I can tell that you're someone who takes their work extremely seriously and has a great work ethic. We're talking about people who only work on their stuff once or twice a week because at all other times they're "not feeling it."
@RealEmberflame Ember I swear to god I will fluster you to the point that you crawl down my throat just so you can protect your image.
@Dellroth You're kinky and have 0 traction though, being immobile~
@DoughyDoe 20 unfollows
Holy shit I can't believe that a tweet of mine that didn't involve a picture got so many favs and retweets.
This bitch at work is making me call a hotel to find out if their hotels have balconies when both their website and ours have pictures that CLEARLY SHOW IT like bitch why can't you call them yourself on your OWN TIME?
@Endie_Dragon @StoutSpaghetti So THAT ONE is fake but: https://t.co/1TnDP1xgLt
It's a slow day at work today...  I want to be happy about it but I know that means that the phone will probably be ringing off the hook tomorrow and I'll be miserable tomorrow to make up for today.
@Endie_Dragon @StoutSpaghetti holy crap they do exist...
@DusterFox one of the reasons why I'm glad I discovered the wonder of VRC and left SL behind.
@SheriffZard ilu2 big guy. â™¥
@TheIrukaMizu @FluffMawnster I could buy so many donuts with that...
@FluffMawnster @TheIrukaMizu What the actual frick. Did the maker just up and disappear or something? Please tell me you made an artist beware over this. That's insane.
@theMuffinButt Yes  Unharmed  *cough*
@Doublefluf I have you down to a t and we've only known each other a few months. |3 I'd call you an open book but you're more like an open muzzle. ðŸ‘€
@RenTradewind The pain of being a fat noodle...
@RenTradewind NOBODY DOES YCH'S IN MY PROPORTIONS REN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I'd totally get them if any EXISTED. ðŸ˜­
WHILE I'M AT IT  Furry artists should do less ych's and more traditional slots. YCH's are lazy on both artists' and commissioners' parts because the artist isn't challenged to try new things and the commissioner doesn't have to think up creative ideas. https://t.co/tfi4nE5ZMm
Hyper hourglass figures are fucking disgusting and incredibly womanizing. It is literally impossible to have massive tits and ass and no belly. *Stop.* https://t.co/tfi4nE5ZMm
@TowerHyena *WHEEZE*
