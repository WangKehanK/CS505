He got sung by a bee and immediately shot straight up into the sky, and all of London heard the Smash Bros announcer say "GAME"
They'll never release the details of his death but I you just know that prince philip crumbled to a pile of dust after stubbing his toe
Prince philip died of ligma
There's a bird singing outside my window at 2:30 am and all I can think is that it must be just as frustrated as I am about not being able to sleep
@IsaacSchutz Puppies that squeak rather than bark :3
Bats are puppy
Fingers crossed for Amazon Union 🤞
It's been almost a week since I got the vaccine and I still haven't tf'd into a kangaroo. What's the deal
@GuloChomp That sounds great! I'll be around then :D
@Beonometry It'll be so good to start actually seeing people again and having a social life :P
@realmaxkeeble I could be wrong cause I haven't used one in like a decade but I think they were a lot more durable than phone cameras too :o
@remygryph I feel like soon as phones started getting better cameras they were outmoded quickly haha
That inflexible usb output looked interesting but wasn't real useful in hindsight
These things were everywhere for like 2 years in the late 2000s and then ceased to exist https://t.co/suVMl7jxXv
lrt is 101% my vibe
So many ppl I know getting vaccinated today :&gt;
Any mutuals want to or know someone who wants to buy a gently used switch lite with Pokemon sword thrown in?
@realmaxkeeble Now it's stuck in my head! The level 1 theme that is
@JoshLipnik sus
Seems like whenever this happens, trans people need to be pulled away from the edge of the proverbial cliff at the last minute by an executive power. We need the political power to make decisions for ourselves and ensure rights can't even be thought about being rolled back.
@remygryph Yayyyy! 😄
I cannot wait to watch movies with friends again, either at their/my place or in a theater :3
Teletubbies is a sequel series to Videodrome
@ottdogbuns "we're burning down what's left of the Amazon rainforest... APRIL FOOLS! But actually we're still doing it so not really"
It's moderna, so I will be fully immune mid may!

Standing at the sink washing strawberries one by one then eating em
Mission failed
@pigeonfaith Yesss! Let's wander the night together looking for animals 🌕
@pigeonfaith I want em tooooo
Might fall asleep before 10 for the first time in years tonight. A miracle
@psykhedelos The piano melody in G Minor specifically make me think of a deep ocean blue for me, kind of relaxing but melancholy
I have pretty strong synesthesia and I'm really glad Blue (Da Ba Dee) actually clocks me as a blue song. If not it would be a huge contradiction entirely from my perception
@themboydeerdog synchronicity https://t.co/AM27rYgsH1
@realmaxkeeble Now people will know when to expect it :P
I decided not to cause that post from a few days ago is still blowing up and changing my profile may confuse lots (thousands maybe) more people thank make them laugh
Not gonna lie I had a pretty funny idea for a non-controversial April fool's joke that involved changing my avi and display name to a famous person
@remygryph What if the caffeine made you grow more :3
What if a band released an album where the art was different on each streaming service, and it'd be just the respective streaming service's placeholder album image
I have got to see king gizz when shows happen again
Window open :)  Leaf blowers :(
Boba roo! Put this together quickly yesterday to see what I could draw in an hour or so to get rid of art block. https://t.co/Z0IqHfyk6K
@NoVibeZone Thanks!! I'm feeling confident it'll come out well :D
@NoVibeZone how about y'all?
@NoVibeZone Doing okay! Got a project for work I've been occupied with this morning
@NoVibeZone Good morning!! 😄
@profqueerman So happy for you!! 💜
@NotGyro I am also wondering about this one. Wish I could "test drive" it somewhere but alas there is a pandemic
@NotGyro *squeaks happily!*
#TransDayOfVisibility means monetary support to trans people https://t.co/bHNNInT90v
My roommate said he thought I was nb the day we first met like 3 years ago so maybe I'm already being seen that way :3
I know there's no one right way to be nonbinary but in 2021 I definitely wanna clock people who don't know me as nb
I'm nonbinary and I hope to be more visibly so in 2021
Gonna plug some resources to help and support trans youth in Arkansas https://t.co/5LEu2zqFCt @intransitiveAR https://t.co/vjPfAJTGIB If you have leftover stimmy money please make some donations and share these resources!
