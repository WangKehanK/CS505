@King_of_kings72 I swear she had an earpiece in to tell her what to say and it was hidden behind her hair
@kenyaannw Follow your gut feeling and make it happen 👏🏼 you’re going to thrive wherever you are
It’s amazing to see MLB making strides toward greater diversity and inclusion.  While with @AppleSox, I’ve seen how female leaders excel in an environment where they’re taken seriously in the WCL.  @Marlins thanks for knowing that women are just as qualified. Kim Ng, you rock! https://t.co/xwNIAtoBKf
About half the scenes from the office remain rent free in my head, I don’t even need a Netflix account anymore
@tequila_lobita @_julessz Me too, it must be rly exciting

😢 it rly do be that way sometimes https://t.co/tzZB7WOcqs
@_julessz On my way! Extra floof in tow
I keep crying thinking about my dog passing away some day 😭
@_julessz Floof insta needs to make a comeback he’s so majestic
@robneyer I started an instagram to document his puppy progress if you want to follow along! It’s https://t.co/YzNw3yNzOU   He’s so cute, it’s painful to leave him alone for any amount of time 🐶 https://t.co/YtUQ8aiQIi
Just a mom with her 8 week old pup Colchuck the Aussie 💙 https://t.co/uuZ2qdE9a6
@leaveitobeavers I’m genuinely laughing/crying out loud reading all of these, thank you so much for the good you’re bringing to the TL, my brother just came downstairs to make sure I was okay- I appreciate historical memes so much ♥️
Cali is burning because of all the leaves?? Also most 7th graders have a better understanding of how fires start and spread than this 😂 https://t.co/zvCCnSGOB4
There’s nothing that hypes me up more than watching that game https://t.co/bBTQDuZBrI
@2020 when does the punchline drop?   Been waiting for 6 months now
@ansleyh17 (4/?) Also yes, she does have her own opinion and she’s more than welcome to go about saying her own opinion, we have that liberty here. Just wish it wasn’t an opinion that’s praising a narcissistic, immature, joke of a leader, bless her heart for thinking Trump is who we need.
@ansleyh17 (3/?) a religious organization as opposed to helping support local businesses, funding local programs, etc?   Aren’t we under the assumption that there should be a separation between church and state?
@ansleyh17 (2/?) Churches are exempt from taxes since they’re nonprofits, so why did they receive any of the aid that they were given?  There were hundreds of thousands of small businesses who received nothing, so why would the people be okay with their taxpayer/government dollars going to
@ansleyh17 (1/?) I understand what you’re saying, but then please explain your reasoning as to why the Church, if they’re going to utilize bailout funds like other companies, received taxpayer dollars this past year.   https://t.co/1j4CuqIpJh
Went and sat at our field the other day... only thing I could think of is how we didn’t even turn the lights on this season.   I know there are other bigger things to be sad and concerned about, but my heart just hurts.   I missed baseball and my @AppleSox  family this summer ⚾️
I’ve never related to anything more in my life 😭😭 https://t.co/MCCJaZmReQ
I don't know why everyone is getting bent out of shape about mail-in voting  TBH it's like having the option to do a take-home test, you can research candidates while sitting in your jammies and eating pancakes on your porch. Also, you can see when your ballot is accepted online! https://t.co/vGr5PlpECI
Time &amp; time again, I’m happy I live in WA b/c we have a coherent &amp; bright leader in @GovInslee when GA has Kemp acting foolish  216K+ cases in a state with 10.62M vs. 66K+ in a state with 7.62M &amp; the 1st few US outbreaks, just shameful 😢 making me sad about my GA roots #maskup https://t.co/xiIutkOcHn
