This is so cute I love this so much https://t.co/xlGs9Ma0NJ https://t.co/SPtRQHrav6
I think one of my fav moments ever is when customers go to tell me they love me and they’re like oh wait what’s your name??
This morning our UPS driver walked in, saw my arm in a sling and said “oooof what now???”
@teeth_ache My dad says I’m cool does that count? I want to help but I have no skills except moral support
Am currently taking applications for a new nose- if you or anyone you know is a cute nose who might like to live on my face, please let me know
And the nerve to look at me like mom why aren’t you laying with us? Girls.... your lifestyle is entirely funded by me I don’t know how you haven’t grasped this yet
Very inconsiderate for my cats to both be lounging in bed while I do my dishes after having worked all day....
I have had a handful of (MALE) custys recently who’ve said something like “you called him dear too...” and been genuinely unhappy I wasn’t only being sweet to them- I’m sorry do you not understand how customer service works? I know I’m overly nice and sweet but Jeesh https://t.co/ClsONJSxqh
I get 1 and I gotta change all socials because it’s the first and the last half decent picture that will be taken of me for around 10 years
I am infinitely jealous of the people who have a different profile pic for every social media and they’re all like really good? Especially the people who update them frequently and still keep them different... HOW DO YOU HAVE THIS MANY GOOD PICS?
Look at this birthday QUEEN she is GORGEOUS https://t.co/6FaIghXIDk

Ive had two good hair days on my two days off and now I’m ready to go back to being ugly as soon as people start to see me for my 5 days of work
I have cleaned most of my apartment so far today and my kitties and my plants are chilling outside in the sunshine, I am so calm and at peace

Fully grown adults in the back seat of a car weird me out- I don’t know why but I do know it’s 100% valid
@mk_ultraviolet Not in Boone but are there any grocery stores that will do grocery delivery? It’s a little pricey but someone will bring dog food to your door in a few hours! Totally willing to send some money your way too
@DurfLyfe @FormerlyLizard I SECOND TARA

Anyone recommend any good ASL classes online? Or like a YouTube series or something. Preferably free or reasonably priced and with a flexible schedule cause a bitch works 40+ hours a week    Thank you 💕✨💕

On Wednesday’s we wear hopelessness and feeling unloveable ✌🏻
Ah Good Morning and welcome to patton ave- first customer this morning wanted an oil burner for $0.60 when the cheapest ones are $1.50- she said she didn’t wanna drive to the other side of town for more money and ma’am that’s NOT my problem

Hi hello someone please convince me not to get a third cat and also guinea pigs
I’ve seen two rainbows so far today and if that isn’t my angels smiling down on me and telling me things are gonna be good then I’m not sure that the hell it means
Was there like an ice earthquake last night or what? Woke up to my whole apartment building shaking and thunder like the Gods doing a step dance I swear
Is a good day when no one at the store changes the music to anything rap or pop - all rock all metal all day 🖤🖤🖤
@ednajane23 Yours is HOT- Aquarius, Scorpio, Virgo is something only like 3 people could pull off and I am far from any of them lmfao
@cupidb4e This is sooooo bad tbh YIKES https://t.co/ehLjaoXpSf
Tbh i think it’s fucked up how trying so hard to be perfect in and of itself can fuck you over- can try so hard you mess yourself up
Today a custy asked me if they could do a back hand spring in the store and I asked if they’d hit anything and they said no so I let them and I have nooooooooo regrets- they even did a cartwheel after 🥰 🤸‍♀️
@teeth_ache I FEEL- I woke up at 6:20 and was like good job girl you made it through Tuesday it’s now Wednesday 😇 but it is not, it is Tuesday and I have not made it through yet
Why yes and for today my magic trick will be consuming two bags of Funyuns as 3 square meals
Good morning- today it is so cold my nipple piercings hurt incessantly🙃

Honestly starting cooking again has really helped me in this weird transition place I am with my ED and I’m super grateful for that https://t.co/3ie4UGy4dI
This is turning into a thread of me throwing myself some self love for starting to cook again https://t.co/QtRBXm1D4s
Honestly one of the biggest lies I continue to sing is FOBs “I’ve been dying to tell you anything you wanna hear cause that’s just who I am this week”- that’s who I’ve been my whole fucking life n it’s who I will be my whole life, come here lemme tell you anything you wanna hear
Also have killed my phone battery 1 1/2 times already today starting from 10 am due to sheer amount of phone calls and other phone things I’ve had to do
One of my employees just told me take a break and when I looked at him and said I am on my lunch break he shook his head at me so disappointed and told me the company wouldn’t do it for me why I am doing it for them and like tbh cause my need for validation and my need to please?
@ednajane23 Seriously y’all hit her up! Super easy to talk to and communicative! And able to explain things in different ways to make your reading understandable no matter your experience level✨ so kind n caring, and everything for me was spot on for me! Feeling really heard n understood ✨

Lowkey I miss learning- does anyone have any educational podcasts/online classes that can be taken at your own pace? Science preferred. Really silly how the school system makes us so sick &amp; tired of “learning” because of the bull shit work done to “teach” us... learning is so fun
I am ready to be that Disney princess https://t.co/IYbkpCYR2J
Which store in the whole region is the only one receiving and second emergency shipment of cream chargers from a different vendor.... ah why yes it is my store 😂
