@madicidetx Nice bro
like fuck dude I work 6/7 days a week and put my blood sweat and tears into my tattoos  I’m not a human printer and if you have to wait for your tattoo I promise you I’ll make it worth the wait
People out here being rude to me over text because of rescheduling  Bro I am human I have a family  There’s days where I mentally cant bring  myself to work. I try to be mindful of everyone but if it’s that huge of a problem I will return your deposit and refuse to work with you
This is a dream come true https://t.co/Udmvju3q6f

Social media validation is toxic and created unrealistic expectations of attention towards a person
so crazy that once I stopped sharing everything my social media presence Im so much happier with my work my life. I get to do tattoos I love even though I share about 10% of my work online. I appreciate everyone who wears one of my pieces and always refer people to me 🖤
