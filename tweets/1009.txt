If you do this and still pretend to be friendly and welcoming to new viewers, eat shit.
His response? To publicly talk about it ON STREAM and ask his chat whether or not he should stop using it.  You can guess how they reacted.  Never have I unfollowed and straight up blocked someone faster on that site
The only bad thing about him was that he had a bad habit of using the term "REEEEEEE" a lot which is kinda ://////  It got worse. Someone anonymously asked him one day if he could stop using it and explained the offensive origins of it, etc.
So, I like to browse TTV for new streamers to watch while I grind in Granblue and one day I came across a chill-sounding dude playing TS4 on the front page; friendly to his chat and not obnoxious despite having a lot of viewers so I dropped a follow and stuck around
Seeing a tweet about Geoguessr reminded me of why I'm wary of Tw*tch streamers with a huge following even if they claim to be "chill" and "welcoming"  I'll explain in the replies since this is already close to the limit

@komoribat there were schools in doma and presumably the empire has them  so i think they've got them, they're just not as refined as sharlayan or ishgard's
