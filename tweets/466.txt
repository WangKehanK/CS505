@Breaking911 So you fire someone for hearsay? 👍🏻 Alrighty then.
@kealeighshown_ Jaz will tell!
@kealeighshown_ @Jasminee_james Omg. U killing me
@kealeighshown_ @Jasminee_james What is that
@JennaEllisEsq Not throwing my own beliefs out there... But are these the same people putting those criminals to death? If so- they should add a clause to the end.
@NashvilleZoo Heartbreaking. :(
@Complex Umm.. wonder if he knows that not eating is going to make him sick too.
@Wayne_C_Hart I might be telling my age here. They stuck to the areas of your teeth you needed to brush better.
@larryelder Not cute Larry.
@jason_tanyh @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA Definitely savage. I’m just wondering why the advice is aimed at Trump though? Oh wait.. is he referring to Biden’s speech in November when he said it wrong- twice?
And yet we continue to vote him in. 🤮 https://t.co/Of1vgMGoGN

@JulianrRoyal You must smell as good as I do. 😘
@henryrodgersdc @realDonaldTrump Wow.
@charliekirk11 You lost me here Charlie.
@SenSanders How has the number “1200” stuck around for many months? There should’ve already been 1-2 more of those checks and another one on it’s way! Kids are homeless, hungry and hurting. We are past the 1200$ mark. People have sunk!

@kealeighshown_ 😂😂you know it!
Is it necessary to stand on someone’s heals in line? Like even when covid isn’t happening?  Like seriously- I might smell good but back up.
@ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump I thought u already were.
@KaneLogsdon  Happy Birthday! 🎂🎁🎈🎊🎉 Love you lots! KEPPPER!
Seeing all the posts from both the left and the right- hoping for tears, laughing at fears- it’s sad.
@JoeBiden If anyone has a plan to “end” this- and they aren’t sharing information to make it happen- they are responsible for any further deaths. It shouldn’t be about winning an election- it should be about saving lives!

@alexsalvinews @OANN Can we answer the question please!
@kealeighshown_ @Sirrom_ It’s not. Only someone who was an abuser themselves would think that.
