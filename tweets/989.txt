We really need to remember to look at the bigger picture. Most people can’t address that their actions can lead to people acting a sort of way TOO. So if you can’t mutually agree to move on from it, it’s time to move on from each other. Acceptance is key
At this point, If were having any overly dramatic issues, you’re just getting cut out of my life. I have no time for disruption of my peace. I’m not a grudge holder so if you’re hanging on to things not worth ACTUAL depth, please move along. People stay mad too long nowadays.
Why do I have to break out this bad everytime Mother Nature shows up
My body wakes me up just to keep me up for no reason
@calmichelee Thank you gf
