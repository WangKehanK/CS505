IM FULLY VACCINATEDDDDDD!!!!
@samlitchfordva @abreezeclayton @JK4Delegate @LynleeGThorne Yessss
@kaayleejuliet I saw that people are getting that! Apparently it’s your lymph node swelling from your body recognizing the vaccine and building immunity to COVID. You still might want to call the doctor to make sure though!
@aguilarja @Target I bought it for ~us~
