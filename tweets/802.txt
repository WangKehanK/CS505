@RonDelph1 @BoyMamaCyn @iamSAR @coltsdave13 @Incredible_Meg i guess that means literally every other NFL player is also a quitter.
smart does not get enough credit for what he does https://t.co/n8bAW45y9h
I seriously don’t understand the Trevor Lawrence hype. I’ve never watched him and gone “wow”. He has size but has trouble getting off of the first read. https://t.co/u2x8QJSnyA
3 sacks allowed in 3 years. Big q no KWESTION https://t.co/lr2kXew647
@coltsdave13 @Incredible_Meg @BoyMamaCyn He was in pain. He had just gotten married. He just had a kid. It was time to move on
there goes my job 😐 https://t.co/bu0ogvfdYk
hot rod 🤤 https://t.co/8udo9EkAHx
@colepearson66 I just don’t understand the hype. yeah he’s got size and the mechanics but has never wowed me. he’ll be good but not andrew luck or peyton manning standards
@colepearson66 he’ll make a point that counteracts another point he made and it goes so on and so on
If the Bengals pass on Penei Sewell I will kidnap Joe and bring him to indy for his own safety https://t.co/dK0GCGzfB4
Colin Cowherd would rather have Trevor Lawrence over  Aaron Rodgers Russell Wilson Deshaun Watson Lamar Jackson Joe Burrow  Matthew Stafford Kyler Murray Dak Prescott  CRAZY

AYEEEEEE I DIG IT https://t.co/g2r0tJ3Dh3
@esidery @LockedOnColts not to mention big q
The colts should get a left tackle, i don’t want the risk of drafting one and he suck, but that doesn’t look to be the case. we’ll save our money, draft a LT, Pass rush, and a WR with our first 3 picks then build up to extend Darius, Q, and Braden Smith. https://t.co/JBHxgJuFGH
@JoelDer979 @MaddenNFLDirect NO NO NO
@C_Rorick @SouthSideSelf @LockedOnColts he always finds a way to make our team better without spending big money. defo was HUGE last year
@SouthSideSelf @LockedOnColts ballard finds a way.... always

@LetsGoColtss @ForTheCOLTure_J i don’t want kemoko back at edge but i don’t want us to spend big money on a pass rusher
@Shockwave195 @NFL @RapSheet sleep tight
😐this is bad😐 hopefully he performs like every other pass rusher (except defo) when they get paid and suck https://t.co/2zC1CQUGtC
@ForTheCOLTure_J offsides, #57....
@Shockwave195 @NFL @RapSheet you wake now?
