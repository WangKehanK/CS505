@tomangell Dear #Democrats, #Liberals, &amp; other #Leftists:  Metaphorically speaking, burn the Democratic Party to the ground, &amp; never look back.
@OnRecliner @JulieBorowski There are definitely some scumbag landlords, but most landlords are decent people just trying to make a living‚Äîcharging rent to A- Pay off the mortgage on their building/complex, &amp; B- Pay for maintenance &amp; repairs of said building/complex.
@elonmusk Well, humanity had a good run...I think...

@KatWeegee Ignore all the people in this thread talking $#&amp;% about her.  She‚Äôs really chill, intelligent, patient, &amp; civil, but there‚Äôs a group of people here on Twitter obsessed with harassing her, misinterpreting every little thing she says or does, &amp; mocking her child‚Äôs health condition.
@ZubyMusic @JohnSRisi The public didn‚Äôt want her, but the Democrat Establishment does.  The amazing thing is that even though she was polling a nearly 0% late in the campaign, now that she‚Äôs VP, people on the Left are like ‚Äúyassss!! slay queen!!‚Äù üôÑ

@KyleKashuv It was a glorious 5 days of memes ü§òüèº
@TheCulturalHall 1st Pres. + the 12 + Pres. Bish. + Sun. Sch. Pres. + Young Men‚Äôs Pres. = 24  Plus the various Quor. of the 70.  Relief Soc. Pres. + Young Wo. Pres. + Pri. Pres. = 9.  There‚Äôs simply more men‚Äîa lot more.  As long as the priesthood is restricted to men, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to be.
@TheTRHL This would be amazing as a cross-stitch.
@AriBerman It‚Äôs called Federalism‚Äîgood job at failing elementary school level civics.
@KassyDillon Prenups are a good thing for people who are perfectly fine with a marriage only lasting a few years.  They should be completely unnecessary for people who want a marriage to last for a lifetime.
@BPROBE2 @AP4Liberty @no1pastryfan Stalin was a *Minarchist*??? https://t.co/x06x23hRF2

@louern @TheAliceSmith You clearly haven‚Äôt been paying attention to enough corners of the Internet‚Äîpeople have been dragging Lennon for a very long time.
@HannahCox7 I was anti-handshakes well before Covid, but some of these are just ridiculous.  Why do people compulsively feel like we *have* to physically touch each other in some fashion whenever we say hello/goodbye???

@PaigeSully88 It can be hard to be yourself sometimes‚Äîbut really it‚Äôs a whole lot harder to try to be someone else.  And we all want to be accepted for who we are, so we might as well embrace it.
@benkesslen I do not consent to my money being devalued any further by the government printing massive amounts of money to let people off the hook who foolishly took on massive amounts of personal debt.  You borrowed money?  Pay it back.  Don‚Äôt make others pay for your mistake.
@jordylancaster If by ‚ÄúBernie‚Äù they mean ‚Äúhypocritical old man who needs to retire‚Äù, then yes.
