@CallofDuty are there any plans to add achievements/trophies for new zombies map in the future? Really love going for them and I was sad Firebase Z didn't have any.

.@Treyarch are there any plans to add achievements/trophies for new zombies map in the future? Really love going for them and I was sad Firebase Z didn't have any.
@TitanfallBlog If someone already has progress towards the guaranteed heirloom will unlocking this reset that? Hate to be 20 cases from a guaranteed heirloom then buy this and have it reset.

. @PlayApex buff Gibraltar please he is weak
@KyxricXIII Wonder if they'll add a regen to his health when his arm shield receives damage
@KyxricXIII shortly after they'll revert the change and add a built in rechargeable caustic trap to his arm shield because their data shows that he loses most of his 1v1
