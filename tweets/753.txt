I have a couple grand in my bank account and I don’t know if I should treat myself to a nice vacation or save up until the end of may and buy myself a new car. I kind of want to go with a new car because it’s about to be a hot girl summer 🥴
Eww why am I craving don julio 1942 🥴 I developed a horrible addiction

I cut so many people out of my life just for no specific reason but my life has been so much more positive. No drama, no fighting, and no wondering if they are still talking behind my back. I’ve been at peace living my best life.
Also I’m going to hell. On Easter Sunday I got drunk as shit off tequila. Snagged this random guy, let my friends lick whip cream off my nipples, danced on a bar table, demolished a seafood boil and fell backwards off my cousins porch 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Especially how people from the outer districts try to criticize us for being too “provocative”
One thing I can not stand about the Rez is how judgmental people are especially when it comes to how people dress. It’s 2021 we wearing whatever the fuck we want
It’s almost 10 pm and I’m drunk lol
I just want a nice looking white guy to room my life this summer. Toxic but fun 🥴
I don’t think I told anyone but when I first start experiencing anxiety fall of 2017 I could not leave my house, I couldn’t look up at the sky, eating anything I didn’t cook scared me and I developed OCD so I was constantly cleaning. I’m so glad I’m  past that now honestly.
@slmousseau Help me
When the guy I’m talking too says he’s taller than 6’3 😩🤤🥴 I rarely find someone I’m interested in that’s taller than me because I’m 6’3 🤣
Really wish I had a bestfriend that had their own money so we can just pack up and travel whenever we want.
God I need to find new hobbies. I’m so tired of partying now honestly.
People will call you a snake for talking to and hanging out with someone they don’t like but forget that mind set when their sitting at a table full of people you don’t fuck with 🤣🤣🤣 fucking hypocrites man
I’m only 24 but why do I feel like I’m running out of time?
People really be proud to steal. Idk I make an honest living and pay for everything so I could never relate. That’s ghetto shit. I SAID WHAT I SAID.
Lmfao I love how my aunties still treat me like a kid. Always asks if I have lunch money and slides me a $20 🤣🤣🤣
Lite house ranch &gt;&gt;&gt; hidden valley ranch.
Everything in California opens up April 1st. I’m definitely planning a trip now. When I said I was traveling all 2021 I meant it 🙌🏻
I feel smothered. I feel like I have too much attention from my friends and relatives. If you really know me than you know I enjoy my alone time.
I had two trips planned within the next 6-8 weeks. Las Vegas for a birthday party end of March and Hawaii mid April but I canceled both trips because of health related reasons. So now I guess I’m just going to buy a new car 🙄
I can’t believe I went to Vegas with a little over 2 grand and I came back home with $65 🙄 thank god payday is this week
Okay okay. I know I just got back from my little vacation but I already booked my room and I’m buying my plane ticket for my next adventure. I’m also shooting for Hawaii in June 🤞🏻I’m just going to live my best life even if I just go by myself.
Eww I have anxiety because I started thinking about how one day my older relatives and friends are going to die 😭😭😭😭😭 if you know me than you know I hang out with mostly people anywhere from 5-15 years older than me.
Eww I don’t know why but I just can not fathom being a whore. I just want to be with one person. I don’t know how these other messy gays just snag around. Probably sharing STD’s too 🤣
@JayyBrew Girl you definitely need it.
Okay but let’s talk how big of a flex it is to be naturally good looking. These hoes be talking about “you just don’t know how to put it on so I’d be mad too” 🤣 first of all we don’t even have to do too much. Brows, lips, and lashes is all we need bb 💋
I use to be so materialistic but now I just want nothing more than to be at peace and travel well I’m still young.
@slmousseau You are someone good in my life 😭❤️
Eww why do all the guys I’ve been talking too for years all have kids now? Lmfao stop messaging me because I am not playing step mom 🤣 jk
I just realized I’ve only ever had 1 serious relationship and it was when I was living in Salt Lake City. I definitely need to make a move before the year is over. I need a fresh start and I want a boyfriend finally.
My mood right now is when you’re laying in bed and it’s a warm rainy summer nights and the twilight movie soundtracks are playing in the background. BEST FEELING EVERRRRR
Up at 2 a.m craving steak stir fry over brown rice 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 it’s been my new fave
I literally do not want to go out in public but I work at a place where I see EVERYONE 🙄🙄🙄🙄 anyway good morning, I might as well get ready for work
I hate when I hangover because I always feel like I did something bad. Deactivated a bunch of my social media because I feel embarrassed 😳 I wild out  and get to crazy when I go out.
I like anime, art, poetry, indie/EDM music, traveling, reading, meditating and a obsession with tea. it’s so hard to find people around here with those mutual likes. I’m getting so tired of going out now. staying in, cooking home made meals &amp; playing video games is my peace now.
