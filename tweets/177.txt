@MakeItRayn_ I‚Äôm also curious as to why it‚Äôs taking so god damn long to pass this COVID bill. People need it NOW.
I understand how Twitter won‚Äôt add an edit button, but they could add a feature where you could correct spelling errors instead of rephrasing or changing the entire tweet.
@abcdedgar @TheSiteSupply @Brael77128329 WTF happened with Walmart today bruh

@TheGreatVen @Gladd Damn for real? That‚Äôs nice. Is the new season worth coming back?
@Gladd I wanna get back into this game but my power level is 650. I feel like it‚Äôs too hard and I never like doing raids.

@mkssavage Most people‚Äôs bodies aren‚Äôt designed to drink milk past their first few years. They get the nutrients from their mother, but as humans develop, we find better sources of those nutrients. Many people are lactose intolerant aswell.
@mkssavage @jasminerocha @AOC I agree with what you mean, like there are many republicans who would die for trump, but there‚Äôs also those ones who are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna follow what everyone else is doing just so I don‚Äôt lose my seat‚Äù type of thing.
@mkssavage @jasminerocha @AOC Okay you make a good point.
@jasminerocha @AOC @mkssavage I know you don‚Äôt like AOC but you can‚Äôt disagree with this

@elizashann I should‚Äôve revised that woops
@elizashann I agreed with some points like the recruiting and all that, but sports without proper testing, especially no rapid tests, are really dangerous, especially since one high school team would play 13 other teams by the end of the season.
