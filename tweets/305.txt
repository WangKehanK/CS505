Being unhealthy is hard and being healthy is hard. Pick your hard.
I hate being asked “what do you do for work?” because I legitimately do like 5 different things and it’s a lot to explain 🥲

I just need to accept that I’ll never win any sneakers I want 😞
Praying I’ll win these bad bunny sneakers 🥲
If anything is gonna hurt might as well make it my body and not my heart so to the gym I go

Idgaf what anyone says. People are gross and predators
18 years old might legally make you an adult, but an 18 year old is still a TEENAGER.
I go through depressive episodes and forget to respond to everyone for like a month and once I feel better I feel guilty texting anyone back, it’s a never ending cycle 🥲
@KaiThePoett Literally! Like no 😭
My dinner today&gt;&gt; https://t.co/QUUvKGXvgU
Being mean and a bad person isn’t a flex.
I hate texting, phone calls and actually going out. I promise I don’t ignore anyone, I just forget to respond 😭
@gabbisharpp @MrPacheco___ Hi can you message me? How much do you need?
This just made my day🥰 https://t.co/wD3kV4YeGU https://t.co/9zbcpyRKRB
This made me miss life pre covid. https://t.co/yl7Niln5wj
Just thought about how I’ve always been so good to men but no one has ever reciprocated the same energy
Read, eat healthy, workout, do something that makes you uncomfortable. Look internally, what flaws can you work on? What’s something new you want to learn?   Love yourself enough to want better for yourself. Grow daily.
Do something for your future self.
@J_realbidness It’s a never ending job but 100% worth it
Life is so unfair.  Some are born to just be buried...
@thediegoguerra I really don’t I was just too tired yesterday from work &amp; didn’t have any meats that were thawed out to eat
Old keys won’t open new doors

Wanted to order some food through DoorDash and the total was $20 for a $10 meal and honestly, I’ll just starve

@dxnilo That is so exciting 🥺
Getting hungry in the middle of a workout&lt;
@RealKhalilU $dianacordoba   I’m trying to get out of debt, leave my shitty job and start a new business 😄

I don’t trust love

Just got fully ready to eat leftovers, and watch Netflix. 😌
@Diolandaaaa I’ve asked this before and everyone just looked at me like I was dumb 😭
@dxnilo Hmmm interesting

When you’re asleep and feel him pull you in and kiss you on the forehead.&gt;🥺
@sylvlozano Omg do it 😍
Please work on your insecurities before getting into a relationship. Toxicity isn’t it.
@J_realbidness Her response was actually funny. You’re a very successful business man and it would’ve taken a two second conversation with you to have known that😭 not everyone cares about luxury items.
@1804Trap_lord Hmmm idk if it is lol will you record it if you see it and send it to me?
@1804Trap_lord that’s what I’m trying to figure out lol did you see it?

Finishline needs to fix their fucking app.😤
What do you do when the person you love the most makes you act like the worst possible you?
My bestie just surprised me with a trip to THE DR 😭😭😭😭
Loving you is a losing game
