@aliviadandrea I wanna thank you for the inspiration you have given me. It's been 4 weeks since I watched your YouTube video on your weight journey and I'm still going strong on my healthy journey. No one has motivated me like you. I love you so much!
@DOMtheB0MB @whomwhatwhur I don't see how someone can confuse you with the other Dom... It's like comparing a knock off Gucci to the real deal. 😅

Am I about to have a glass of wine at 11:30am while laying in the sun listening to miranda lambert on spotify.... Yes, yes I am. Mind your own business. 😊
@TheRoss05 Yeah, I'm sad about it. 🤣

My trust issues so bad, i'm so mistrusting of new movies sometimes, that i just watch old ones again that i know are good...😅
Finished the first season of Reckoning on Netflix and I've been blue balled by the ending. Now I have to wait till 2022 for the second season. 😅 this is bs
All those "haunted house" tales where a cat stares at the wall, meows at nothing, then bolts across the room, all probably stem from people not knowing how cats act when they're bored.🤣
Schools will renovate their whole gymnasium and still wont bring down the ball stuck on the ceiling since ‘06.

@Amber_Nicole005 Good to know I'm not alone. 🤣
I don't what this says about my current mental health, but the sun coming through my window right now and hitting me in the face gives me anxiety....🤣
@Re1DonaldJTrump @WhiteHouse God bless you and your family. 💙

I just wanna shout out @SHEIN_official. Their Curve + Plus line is on point. This is a size 1XL and it fits like a glove. It's so hard to find jeans to fit my body type. I never buy my jeans anywhere else. 😍😭💕 https://t.co/zLLTrHpCuV

Shout out to @hayley_gabby for sending me 15 dollars for Christmas. That was just the exact amount I needed to reach the exact amount of money I needed for my next month payment for my college payment. 😭 God works in mysterious ways. Love you girl. Thank you so much. I love you.
@KendallRaeOnYT One word:  Psychopath

I'm thankful for my mom &amp; dad to have that time to talk to each other again. To hear them say how much they loved each other &amp; talk about old memories together. Thats what gives peace. He needed that, we needed that. He was an amazing man. I'm just happy to have those memories.
