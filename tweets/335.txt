Me: it's coffee Sofia: NO COFFEE IS EVIL Me: ITS SWEET I PROMISE Sofia: NO!! 😱  Then she threw a packet of crackers at face like so https://t.co/S7VbBmWV4n
Ima say it, it's perfectly fine not to invite friends to things sometimes when you don't want to go out your way and drive them.  It's not trying to shame them for not being able to drive/living far, it's just a responsibility not everyone wants to deal with sometimes
Yup I've now awaken feeling like shit
