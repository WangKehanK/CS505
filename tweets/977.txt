@CatGirlCrusader He‚Äôs asleep on my feet right now he‚Äôs my best friend I love him
@CatGirlCrusader Here‚Äôs the live version that I think is kinda funny https://t.co/9ukSXj9XVA
@CatGirlCrusader Yo check THIS shit out https://t.co/8eCdc3HrZ2
Literally everything quoted in text is false. The bill of rights IS absolute even if it‚Äôs been violated over and over. You CAN yell fire in a theater if it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone. You absolutely 100% could own ANY weapon, including fully armed warships, in the beginning. https://t.co/HvsCF2zZd9
@DylanMAllman The ‚Äúfire in a crowded theater‚Äù shit annoys me so much. In that example we talk about *using speech to directly harm others* so if we use an actual equivalent in guns, we would say it therefore should be illegal to open fire in a crowded theater. Which it is, obviously
@di_x36 Truer words have never been spoken
This account is literally just ‚Äúdudes down bad‚Äù again. Literally the same screenshots https://t.co/KG7ok4lLdm
@ToddHagopian Standing at the origin of an infinite orchard where perfectly thin trees are planted on every lattice point, you spin and randomly stop, pointing a perfectly thin laser out straight in front of you. What‚Äôs the probability you hit a tree with the laser?
Absolute top tier tweet https://t.co/YSvYGIQas0
@di_x36 Damn right it‚Äôs not a joke üòé
I straight up don‚Äôt deserve my girlfriend like how does she follow me on Twitter and still think I‚Äôm worthy
@AndyinDC1 @Ace_Archist You know people pay to adopt children already right? Where is the issue in that system we have now?
@FloristElise If it‚Äôs not a 4 hour movie directed by zacharious snideman I don‚Äôt fuckin WANT IT
@DylanMAllman Of course assuming we use a definition of request that exclude jokes and such, I think one should be held accountable no matter what tool they use to violate others even if the tool they use is free thinking and could have refused.
@BTRBT_ @Ace_Archist I was playing with fire just yesterday and I am not ashamed to admit it
Kind of crazy it needs to be said but AOC is not an anarchist she is not NEARLY that cool https://t.co/D5Ultv8QDy
I went on a little retreat with my friends this week and I had to drive through Denver AND Boulder TWICE and I gotta say that was the most aggravating drive I‚Äôve ever had fuck you if you drive in those cities I should be the only one allowed to drive y‚Äôall can‚Äôt handle it clearly
@JoshuaAtLarge Getting engaged in a pullover hoodie is how you know she knows exactly who you are and loves you for it
People be like ‚Äúbitcoin bad for the environment mmm print more fiat there are no environmental impacts of the monetary status quo‚Äù
@MarcDClair True on all counts
@MarcDClair Either way, I don‚Äôt think that private business decisions should be part of the discussion yet. Let‚Äôs squash the talk of state mandated options first then talk about nuances of private businesses
@MarcDClair I don‚Äôt really see any reason a truly uncoerced and separated-from-the-state business shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to exclude anyone they want from their business. Obviously banning it is the lesser evil than requiring it, by a LONG shot, but still not ideal.
@LibertyLockPod Careful he might dm you for the next 3 days straight demanding to know if you‚Äôre Jewish
@HuntyDraws Wizard frog üê∏ I love wizard frog
@_lanyewest_ For real though definitely tell your manager that that customer specifically makes you extremely uncomfortable because he says inappropriate things you. If they‚Äôre a good manager they‚Äôll help you out and if they‚Äôre not a good manager at least someone knows that there is a problem
@_lanyewest_ Stab him
The worst thing about this tweet is that I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not a troll https://t.co/iWC8dRORZj
@epicweedgamer @discount_cat @shoe0nhead History tells us it‚Äôs the incels waiting for a bunch of virgins in the afterlife
@ScurvvyMcDogleg @discount_cat @shoe0nhead Hey now that‚Äôs just mean
@ScurvvyMcDogleg @discount_cat @shoe0nhead It‚Äôs not about the size of the brain it‚Äôs the girth of the cock
@discount_cat @shoe0nhead Not if me and my community shoot them with the machine guns we acquired after abolishing the government that tells us we can‚Äôt have them (or if the Corp collapses because there‚Äôs no more corporate welfare that would be easier)
@shoe0nhead Corporations wont send a death squad to my house and shoot my dog because I talked about wanting to buy cocaine so I‚Äôm definitely more concerned about one than the other
I‚Äôm the luckiest man on earth truly
Please I‚Äôm begging you, stop having people who know nothing about guns write articles about guns it‚Äôs so fucking embarrassing reading ‚ÄúSBRs are illegal because they can penetrate armor‚Äù https://t.co/a0YmnOLJpA
@TravyTravVA Drinkin a chug jug right now gamer
@TravyTravVA My back hurty but not brokey
I fell down the stairs today and I‚Äôm feel pain

@FlamzyArts @TrinsCabbage That grape got a DUMPY
@checkmatestate Literally I can only think of the Rwandan genocide that comes close to being non governmental. And that‚Äôs all it does - comes close.
@Kwcalhoun1 @RealSpikeCohen @michaelmalice @Pdog119 @profcjdotorg Prof CJ is the coolest dude in history podcasts IMO I love his work. To people who doubt I always like to point out that one of Washington‚Äôs big successes in the beginning of the war was ambushing people in the dead of night on Christmas
Hi there, I‚Äôm a car owner. I have in my garage, right at this moment, 2 Jeeps, a Buick, a Ford and a Subaru. Which is a lot, considering only I know how to drive. Now let me tell you how this qualifies me to talk about cars in depth and how you‚Äôre weird for liking Nissan. https://t.co/kR5SjECfH1
@RealSpikeCohen @michaelmalice @Pdog119 Really ignoring the fact that they did better in that war the less organization they had. Small militias running guerrilla attacks on the British was effective then the continental army formed and they started fighting the European way and started losing.
@UndeadCullan As long as they can keep their power and get paid to help the saudis commit genocide in Yemen not a single one of them gives a shit what happens to anyone ever. I love government
@UndeadCullan Politicians are a waste of oxygen
Was gay would the atf say literally anything about national puppy day they KNOW what people are gonna say https://t.co/YNsp9y8uwp
I like girlfremb https://t.co/5MfaIUtrU4
@Bubola @northexpedition Now he can make 10 more and bring em back. It‚Äôs like a pyramid scheme but where the only sucker is the cops
@HuntyDraws Yo that‚Äôs crazy we‚Äôre in the same career field!
@_lanyewest_ It was fucking a couple people from Yogscast then rooster teeth then a couple OG youtubers like cry then Carson now this and the worst part is I KNOW IM FORGETTING SOME IN THERE https://t.co/s7vnktONxS
@_lanyewest_ Another one https://t.co/7q7cakebVb
@marymak @UndeadCullan @HuntyDraws Damn moms ruin everything, amirite fellow teens?
@TemetExodus @LibertyAnders I don‚Äôt just get it, I loosely remember reading the thread that inspired the meme I‚Äôm online too much https://t.co/LugO5bwphY
@Creeyn Show https://t.co/dYKn0r8z57
@Zarathanarchy I‚Äôm a straight guy and this made me fall in love with you
@DavidFite @JoshuaAtLarge I misread at first too, but josh is saying the small l‚Äôs are being whitepilled *about* the party. The usage and placement of ‚Äúon‚Äù is the trickster
@Sakyuvi I did this a long time ago over and over and it took way too long for me to realize she didn‚Äôt love me like she said she did. Remember that you are worth loving and you deserve to feel loved. Hope you feel better soon &lt;3
@LibertyLockPod @ReedCoverdale Man I‚Äôm glad you don‚Äôt use that anymore I always liked your takes but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to actually follow because I hated seeing that Togolese picture lmao
Fucking paradox games man it‚Äôs almost 5 am it only felt like I‚Äôd been playing for like 2 hours

@_lanyewest_ Julius Fraser sounds like someone who would be a guest on joe rogans show
@_lanyewest_ Stab the boy
@Zepure_H @ShaneTHazel For the record volunteerism and voluntaryism is different
@RebelScumHan An old republic movie with Keanu Revan would be amazing. Not only does he have the look I think he has the perfect voice. I didn‚Äôt super like the voice they gave him in the old republic mmo
@Rafiqomairr @ThePersephonies @DeanScorpion_ Some definitely do get crazy about it, I‚Äôve had a girlfriend like that but I agree this girl definitely seems like she‚Äôs just poking fun
