@lilginger12 Bish they quit, she’s desperate now
@relivorganix @_RyanTucker @qubeofweed Reliv Organix says they will date you Ryan
@promiseseed315 @prageru Are you stupid on purpose?
@prageru Recent...history? Research and data? We still have grandparents alive who faced America’s racism. Jim Crow ans segregation weren’t enough? I guess it’s hard trying dodge the unfortunate answer lmao.
@otragringuita Aw thank you!!! 🥰🥰🥰

@JeffSte93914782 @StephenKing @elonmusk A whippet is a breed of dog
@lilginger12 No we know this is totally normal
@IDJoe4Congress Abolish the majority in debt
@amk__001 Are they also implying protesting civil rights somehow caused the 9/11 attacks?
Imagine being just as poor as everyone else and still getting mad at poor people https://t.co/XdXcA0gH8o
@yaf I’m assuming none of them go to college because not once has a professor ever brought up their political beliefs except in POLS 💀
@arcadianwinds @WingitP51 @YourAnonNews I love how this thread was tagged as “possible offensive content”

I still don’t get why “antifa” which literally is not an organization, is still considered fascist. How stupid is the right
@BadMedicalTakes Hot take: women are no longer classified under “people”
Don’t be stupid on purpose.
Someone said it’s just a family reunion between the cops and conservatives at the capitol lmao
They’re still crying in the streets “stolen election”, “burn the country down” the trump 2020 flag is somehow their new American flag...we have another curfew, trump goes to jail, of course that was rigged and unjust as well, so much fun!
Uhh 2021 Jan 20th and forward..something like, Biden won’t have a typical inauguration, trump won’t even show up, afterwards he’ll be permanently suspended from Twitter, the trumpers no longer align with the Republican Party, more domestic terrorism...
@BMWBenzBentlee I know we’re on the same side, I don’t know what you mean
@BMWBenzBentlee I genuinely do not know how to be “more aware”, please give me some info that says otherwise. I see the news articles from other countries. I see how we’re repeating history. I see how the alt-right’s claims are rooted in nothing but lies and false fear
This is quite literally one of the worst developed countries, thanks to trump and his klansmen (fans) it is a CULT
@stillgray Careful, he might get on Fox News again crying about getting bullied on Twitter
“2020 was so hard on all of us, can’t wait til quarantine is over 😩🖐” https://t.co/PitokX0x8B
How come I have to feel embarrassed about every show I genuine like 😭😭 I get it I have bad taste but at least I’m happy 😂
@merrittk Why did I read “hour” like “four”
I can’t STAND when ppl would “predict” my actions or be like “oh I expected that from u ur a cancer” shut up
People will vent online about bad habits caused by a rough past or whatever and there’s really that one person in the comments like “sounds like you’re a libra or have major libra placements”???? Like why idk but that makes me mad and I can’t explain it
Damn apple is good https://t.co/c8iq9nzVT9
Learn the difference between loose and lose, and breath and breathe today
“Yeah you go girl! Datin a white man” 💀💀💀😂
@NatashaMLee That’s weird, I always considered married couples living together a family, why are people so bitter
@Dicelol_ @Fadedwxtch @IBoppedU Good thing religion isn’t real LMAO
@Moh_jjk I like how there’s no in between, it’s either everyday or once every 5 months
@OcheDaniel247 @JoelOsteen His house can look like whatever the hell he wants. It’s the irony of a multimillionaire preaching when the Bible is adamantly against greed, excessive wealth, and he literally turned hurricane victims away from his mega church. Talk about being humble
@JohnDeLaneyCLU @JoelOsteen Oh that’s right, my favorite part of the Bible is the part where you’re supposed to be rich and greedy while giving none of your wealth to the needy. Oh wait I guess his “charity” is him telling us “god has a plan!!” While he lives in luxury and we lose our jobs.
@neiltyson I’m so excited!! 🙌

@litdesu This trailer is so painful to watch, why is it obvious it’s their first time memorizing lines, why didn’t they fix the mistakes 🖐😭
@dameliosonhulu @hulu @charlidamelio @dixiedamelio @heididamelio @marcdamelio @dameliofamily LMAO Hulu how desperate are you 1-10? The only positive responses I could find were from about 10 fake accounts 💀💀💀 they really saw that trailer and said “this is it”? https://t.co/bUoMi3VSGp
