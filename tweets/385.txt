If you’re thinking to yourself “why am I so depressed!!” maybe check to see when is the last time you refilled your meds because maybe you’re like me and it’s been two weeks

Anyone know where I can get 1/6 scale animals. I need an owl, a mouse, a raven/crow, and maybe a bat. Maybe a dog but that’s easier to find I guess.   #dollhouse #dolls #sixthscale idk I don’t know how to reach a wider audience

@ANTlGONE EXACTLY!!! the doctor sees the potential in them and theyre just randos... like rose isnt even in college or anything, martha is a doctor but sees herself as very ordinary, donna is just some lady, but they all LOVED and were GOOD AT adventure!

@ANTlGONE clara and amy's problem actually is that they are extraordinary. martha, rose, and donna are all normal people and the doctor sees their extraordinaire-iness anyway. amy and clara were stated to be extraordinary from the start which makes us as an audience relate less
