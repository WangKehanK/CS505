today in class one of my 1st graders hugged me, told me I was soft and squishy, then asked me how much I weighed and if they could pick me up 😐 https://t.co/RiEIXUie62
@TheRealGooseMom Hahahaha
@TheRealGooseMom I refUse to believe there was ever a time when I wasn’t invited into your space. I’m not a vampire.. unless
remembering the time I was shopping for instacart and needed scallops... thought it was odd that a brand wasn’t specified and weirder yet when the app wouldn’t let me swap with any brand of scalloped potatoes. Glad an employee could help me out. So anyway
@TheRealGooseMom No no I have PTSD from all of the times you’ve asked me to wake you up.. promising you won’t rip my throat out. Nope. Even after 7 years it still terrifies me 👹 just-woke-up Bash is a demon.

Before getting my covid test the nurse asked if I knew how it worked. I made joke about it being like a free lobotomy and she immediately put the swab down, looked me dead in the eyes, and in the most serious tone told me that it absolutely would not touch my brain. 🤦🏼‍♀️I know..
I’ve been having a lot of very obscure memories pop up lately which is probably just a symptom of boredom or adhd idk BUT my brain won’t accept that &amp; wants to know like what if I died and the whole “life flashing before your eyes” thing just takes a lot longer than we thought??

My grandpa got this in the mail today. I wish it was a joke, but it’s not. It literally reads like an SNL skit. Basically if you don’t vote for orange man the libs will murder babies, “force you” to walk to work, and take away your air conditioning..? WHAT?? https://t.co/AqtdxLkMpN
It’s about the Holocaust BUT that’s not the point. I literally didn’t know what it was about when I asked. The title just caught my attention. After that, every book report I did was on a book about self-harm, suicide, and/or addiction... but nobodyyy ever questioned that 🙃
I just had a very weird and specific memory of when I was in elementary school &amp; for Xmas I asked my entire family for a book titled “One Eye Laughing, the Other Eye Weeping” and like... maybe I should have gotten a therapist instead idk
remember before cell phones when we were all mini secretaries for our parents?? Like if they didn’t want to answer/talk to the caller we could just say they’re unavailable &amp; we’ll take a message. It gave them a perfect excuse to never have to return a call.. just blame the kids🤫

@SJSchauer A 3-4ish year old boy once asked if I had a penis.. when I told him no, he got super excited and said, “heyyyy! That’s just like my mom! She doesn’t have one either!!”
Made a risky investment, turned a profit, and now I’m convinced that I am Wall Street. *and you can too!* but wait... there’s more. Use my code to get free #stonks.

@TheRealGooseMom Call it what you want... the governor literally gave us all permission to go outside and “howl” (scream at the top of our lungs) at 8pm every evening and I’m HERE for it.
Bethany we made them bestsellers bc we literally want to die. What don’t you understand? https://t.co/sRWnFrVVnp
I love that ppl are checking in on each other but also - why?  I could literally say that I sit in my cellar in pure darkness as a feverish attempt to escape the existential dread that is consuming my soul &amp; they’d be like lol yea this is crazy right 😆!!
today I traded my Uggs for a packet of sanitizer wipes. This new timeline is wild.
Grandpa told me, “Let’s just clean and get it over with before I’m dead.” This is a whole MOOD and I’m here for it.
This is Quarantine, an unintentional art series shot while trying to convince my fiancé to help me around the house. I was not amused.   What does quarantine/isolation look like for you? #Covid_19 #QuarantineLife https://t.co/JAJ7HT6UyM
@charles_dailey the gov is gonna send us boxes of spiders just to double down on the craziness. Like April Fools, losers! I’m more confident in the scammers who’re like LOL these h8ers don’t believe me- send your SSN &amp; DOB and I’ll prove it!!  @ TheGovernment just Venmo me pls @KatieGruman 🤞🏻 https://t.co/yaJCyiB337
@kayschulte Oh here’s the extra “fun” part... the kids (kindergarteners) need to follow the 6ft rule and they can’t have anything that can’t be uber sanitized so no balls, crayons, board games, puzzles, stuffies, blocks, electronics, etc. and they can’t go on the playground/swings 🙃
Oh! And if we get that doctor note and take “too much” leave then we’ll lose our health insurance benefits.
The average cost of treatment *with insurance* is about $1,500.  So my choices are to either take unpaid leave (if I can get a doctor note) or risk getting sick and go into debt. Awesome.
I’m considered an essential worker. As a childcare professional I have to go back to school to watch first responder’s and doctor’s children. There are not enough tests for us. There are not enough tests for the children. W t f   but hey they’re giving us $5 more per hour... 😐
caught myself singing along to Nickelback while cleaning today... so if someone wants to come ol yeller me I’m ready
Blessed be the fruit loops. https://t.co/veWeTl15oM
