Who says they have to fight? 🤷🏽‍♀️ They’d get together and take down everyone in sight!  (Also writing this as someone who made Leighton Meester Paris’s just as acerbic cousin in my fic, so I might be biased) https://t.co/XPcjqjUdI6
The Netflix Ponzi guy Deadline talked about yesterday has a Wikipedia article...that he paid for...and the saddest thing I saw on there is...  'He is married to his long-time partner'  Yes, we generally marry our partners...but they become our wives after that point, dumbass. 😒
Dollar Tree’s going to have to expand their book aisle by the end of 2024 to sell off post-45 books nobody will ever buy (and those that were written during his term). https://t.co/FRpcFAgnFn
@ViolentFemme_ I still have never understood why if you’re part of a video website where you could conceivably contribute content in the wilds of Saskatchewan, you are somehow required to move to California to make content with others.

Congrats to @RyanSorensonWI on becoming the mayor-elect of Sheboygan! I’m glad to have a mayor younger than me for once. 😆
Would be nice if the local radio station covered the local mayoral race this evening instead of taking it to whatever conservative satellite garbage airs after the Brewer game. 🤬

Last commercial coming out of a break during the local news is for a home medical provider...  And two minutes later, they have breaking pictures of a car driving into the same home medical provider's building (nobody was injured!). 😂 #timing
@ubiquitousmixie Me, but add 'in about 26 chapters after 600,000 words of exposition/slow burn/emotional conversations/distractions'.

@Dom_iniqueLee There are many more AAPI candidates that speak better than him, and it’s an insult that the media just keeps going back to him and his awful campaign.
I admit, I watched many a RedEye episode pre-45 and enjoyed them…and I’m sad this is where he’s ended up. Andy Levy is definitely missed for sure. https://t.co/yukolYIp5b
@TheFienPrint There was a local car dealer who died a year ago with the corniest March Madness pun ads around (think old, old man rejecting a slowly-thrown b-ball and saying ‘Rejected!’), and I think those ads would’ve gone perfect with the Geico ads.
@capmarine276 @nataliemorales @BJMendelson Meanwhile here we found someone whose growing uglier because of the hate in their heart 🤬, while Nat's become hotter with her kindness through the years 😊.

Also, we get it Rogan writers. Logan HATES anything lower class. Can we fucking stop this? A hostel, taxi, or walking home is JUST FINE! These things are not going to harm Rory or this sudden new daughter he’s dealing with!!
Another Rogan fic, another story where the one impediment to a later-in-life Rogan HEA is taken care of with a dead wife. 🤬  It’s either ‘crazy wife’ or ‘dead wife’ for these couplings lately (or Odette is a RH candidate). Can we have a normal Logan wife for once?!

Remember, whenever you comment on a story with the ‘no one cares’ Fox searchlight GIF…you cared enough about the story to click the “GIF” button, search for ‘no one cares’, selected it and then posted about how ‘no one cares’, so you’re lying and you DO care about a story. 😉
Am now officially at the point of writing a fanfic partially set in Portland where all of my social ads are encouraging me to visit Oregon or subscribe to the Oregonian. I should be glad I’m not getting ads regarding being a new dad since it involves children. 😂
@Jay00789 They found the kids, which is good news. I just don’t understand people who are so hostile about being warned about things. Lady is probably one of those who gets all Kareny when the Bachelor is interrupted by a tornado heading for her house. 😒
You…you know that an Amber Alert is beyond the control of your cable company, right? That they don’t use it to censor news channels, just to let you know of emergencies like a MISSING KID IN WISCONSIN which is much more important. 😒 https://t.co/miITvJ0xNV

It really, really sucks to feel sick for no reason out of nowhere while you're sleeping. 🤢 Am I just suddenly feeling vaccine effects for a bit out of the blue, or just feeling for everyone else who is getting it and sharing how they're feeling in solidarity?
@PLPoutyMouth I stopped watching years ago but the entire time I did it was like ‘he has a wife so that ship isn’t happening for me’.

Sorry to inform you all, but I heard from a reliable source that in AYITL2, Paris marries Logan, Anna, Luke and Lorelai are polyamorous, and Mitchum is actually Rory’s baby daddy.  #AprilFools (I couldn’t even type that all without cringing!)

@luvu2golka Old people who won't change the channel after "Wheel of Fortune" or "ET".
…right now, I’m really enjoying Edge much more than Chrome since I switched to the Mac last May. Only other issue is weird…Instagram stills are blurry. But I can always open the Chrome shortcut for now.
It seemed daunting to move my browsing there, but in reality, it only took an hour to get my Edge looking exactly like my Chrome has for years, including my extensions. And so far, no crashes. It hasn’t eaten up my RAM. I may still eventually try Safari for a full day, but…
Have made the move from Chrome (which seems to glitch out a lot since the latest MacOS update and FREEZE IT UP fix it!) to Edge…outside of its muscle memory not being quite there yet (I use one site a lot…but it keeps going to another), I’m really enjoying it.
Addison Rae said she couldn't give credit to the dancers she imitated?  Jimmy was literally holding cards up that could fit an @ and a full name rather easily. And we've had lower-thirds since at least the late 60s. What an embarrassing situation!
