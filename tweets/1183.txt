I'm not as close to some people as I used to be but I'm still rooting for y'all from afar
physically: i could run 3 miles mentally: i could sleep for 3 days
my secret talent is that i can sleep for 10 minutes and be completely energized
i love that my professors and advisors actually know me, it’s literally the best part about going to a smaller college
the birds are singing and outside feels like spring
“I was in class and my teacher asked us what the prettiest thing we’ve ever seen was. Everyone said all these different places and things, but all i could think of was you.”
@brooklynn_1_2_3 it was funny as hell 😂❤️
some guy waved at me while i was running and then his gf smacked the hell outta him
