Whoever is seeing my tweets trying to cause me and others problems for NO REASON, can you please mind your damn business? I’ve been through enough.
Okay now that I’m being treated right...how do I act?????????????
Seeing Everly with someone who chooses to love her and be involved as much as possible even though it’s not their job makes my heart so happy for her. This kid really does deserve it. She is so happy...🥺🥰
It’s not about the guy with the most money, best truck, or anything else. It’s not even about blood. Right now it’s about the guy that treats my daughter like she’s his own. It’s such a good feeling seeing her get the attention and love she never got before.
Even if you came back into my life I stg you’ve missed so much like ???? You’ve not even met my kid and you were supposed to be her god mom...but ig that’s what happens when ppl use u
