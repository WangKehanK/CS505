@Tom_Bedford I’ve been looking into this the last few months.  I’ve been using a Stryd pod and realized how off things can be.
@Marlon_Mack25 on a scale from one to ten,,, how healthy are you?
@therunchat B
@bennettrun I sent you a DM, try to find that.
@mattjames919 What marathon you looking at?
@HOKAONEONE coming through with the big contract 😂 @mattjames919 https://t.co/h7kQwcC74D
@GarminCareers I’m Garmin’s biggest fan.  I’ve applied over and over.  Who do I talk to?     Best, Jesse
@GarminFitness Do I get an attempted badge ?
@HDBeenDope Dude went through it.  I had to stop watching but glad he had a platform to sort his thoughts out.  Very funny guy
@subaru_usa In the next 20 years I’ll trade in my Impreza Sport for a WRX 😭
@onidine @MellieDarcy @AbigailGambel Key word “slightly matted” most are BAD.
@MellieDarcy @AbigailGambel RT.  People don’t know they gotta brush their doodles daily.  Then get mad that it has mats.  Most groomers should refer them to a vet instead of trying to help.
@Bose I absolutely love my Soundsports when they work but the connectivity on these is absolute trash.  I’ve updated, clear Bluetooth memory , etc. always a hassle getting them to connect before a run.  Most runs I have to leave them behind.
@garyvee Gary soon. https://t.co/CayKasOQic
@Strava is it possible to merge my old account into my new account?  I just realized all my old runs from over 2 years ago are on a different account and would like to have them on my new.  Thanks! Big oof on my end .
@garyvee Be able to get things done without being baby sat aka a go getter!

@GarminFitness any word if @Garmin will release iOS widgets?  That’s would be killer to get my steps on my home screen.

@garyveetv @garyveebot
@garyvee @davidrocknyc @TeamGaryVee there is a snippet , video, blog, etc of Gary talking about how he grew up with friends much older than him that taught him some of the foundations of his success today over hanging with people his age.  Can someone point me in that direction?
