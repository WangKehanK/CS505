@DanSlott I‚Äôm probably one of the few people who actually likes Superior Spider-Man.
@virg0visi0n Pretty sure we want Sam to be the new Captain America. And I do too. https://t.co/B5sgAbEmZx
@BigK641337 @CoopNyl @captainrobonoid They came back though.
@Liberty_S117 I want my rogue back
@Rookie38165856 @Kilo3Rosee Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Rogue for life!
Nice https://t.co/5k1wrTYO9V
God damn it.   This game better be good. https://t.co/tfRP6gV97r
I would totally want Ash Williams to appear in Doctor Strange 2, no joke. https://t.co/95uYYnv1Et
Who the hell would wanna work at EA nowadays anyway? https://t.co/fN0wjWubn4
@SpicyHalo_ I think you have ODST confused with 5.
@skurletonVA I want him back too. https://t.co/HaGmLDfvKZ
Spoilers for the #SnyderCut but I wanted to make this edit all week, and now I have a new laptop so I was like, ‚Äúgotta break the rule Barry‚Äù https://t.co/8yZlkeyHLg
@TNAScontinued Oh thank god. I was worried D:
Listen to Salty. It‚Äôs really stupid that people think stuff like ‚Äúthis guy would never‚Äù and stuff like that.  Everyone‚Äôs trying to cancel everyone and it‚Äôs not even fun, or worth anyone‚Äôs time and energy.  I just wanna play with my Legos and make videos. https://t.co/Ey5z68aRFr
@rickyberwick US Agent. And he‚Äôs probably gonna be evil or something.
@BastianInuk @Asim_Crash @LorcanHedgehog I‚Äôm a boomer I don‚Äôt speak /S
@CarmenRiderYT @womenofmerlin People do that on Twitter. Trust me. It ain‚Äôt worth the effort.
@amysguinevere @CarmenRiderYT As a gay man, I am very confused by why you decided to wake up and smell the non-existent ashes today.
@DangervilleTeam @snydercut @wsepulved32 @hbomax He always wanted a black and white cut. Mad Max: Fury Road and Logan got black and white versions too.
@mattlovescinema I have zero complaints about this scene. Like... none.
@amaurysart @Deckerstarendgm @mattlovescinema Hell yeah. Flash and Cyborg got MAJOR changes and they were perfect.
@KaleeshWarlord Hell yeah https://t.co/vkeLYzv1jd
@Asim_Crash @LorcanHedgehog You don‚Äôt have kids though
@Teashire_Farce Oh most definitely
It‚Äôs not though. That belongs to Batman and Joker‚Äôs final confrontation in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. The Bruce Wayne Batman not Terry McGinnis. https://t.co/mu4QC3Cnkv
@RexOrchid He didn‚Äôt just ruin Ray‚Äôs performance. He cut out his ENTIRE story. I‚Äôm so glad Zack brought it all back and then some.
Another thing I wanna say is that @ray8fisher was absolutely fantastic as Cyborg in the #SnyderCut. I‚Äôm glad we finally got to see his full performance come to light. And I hope that the big boys who tried to push him and the crew down get what they deserve. Legally of course. üëç

Not gonna lie. They do know how to make superheroes look good https://t.co/Eq3068rfEE
@benoski73 CW 2003 is a classic. And also an excellent example of Genndy Tartakovsky‚Äôs work.
So I guess that whole TF2 community exposure thing happened. Not really surprised by what the kid had to say, but still. You‚Äôd be surprised how many communities are like this.   Also, if you‚Äôre 14, you REALLY shouldn‚Äôt be on social media. Like, at all. Just a thought.
@TrevorMason117 Upgrade is such an underrated movie.
@AlieEnigma And there was no advertisement for it?
How? https://t.co/AtoqKYCh91
YES!!!!! https://t.co/GYvcwZbe68
@benoski73 I‚Äôm definitely buying Republic Commando again
@ECNALHANID Why is Mysterio here?
No :) https://t.co/LxJ4TOAy1H
How the everlasting fuck has Ninjago lasted this long? I wish Bionicle was like this. ;-;  But hey, I'm just glad this is still even around. https://t.co/Rd20fjCs64
@tthblox I got Portal 2 on PC the day it released. Pre-ordered it actually at GameStop, but I never redeemed that pre-order bonus.  Nonetheless, it became my favorite game of all time.
The replies to this are not pretty. Proceed with extreme caution. https://t.co/OHRFiwm1xV
04.18.2021  Portal 2‚Äôs 10th anniversary.   What‚Äôs coming to my channel on that day? Find out when the day arrives. ;)   #Portal2 https://t.co/TG9iduD2H0
I‚Äôm too tired to type too much on Twitter, but here‚Äôs a rundown of my current situation from my Discord group (which I‚Äôll open to the public sometime in the future) https://t.co/Iqs2Z1MC8p
@JDV_17 They took away his stupid tattoos. And his grills. And his super flashy femboy gangster look, which doesn‚Äôt work for the Joker at all.  So that‚Äôs like... three good things.  I‚Äôm not really expecting much from him in the Snyder Cut. We‚Äôll just have to see how it turns out. https://t.co/FCJAP3Hza0
For those who are messaging me and asking me to do voiceover lines, I am currently unable to do any voice acting until further notice. I‚Äôve misplaced my equipment and I‚Äôll probably need to buy a replacement microphone cord. On top of that I have college work to attend to. üòû
