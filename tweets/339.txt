@CourageousRobin dont u have a mutual whose goal in life is to fuck chrom or am i misremembering
too many people on this bad bird site feel comfortable not holding themselves accountable for hurting others and i cant understand that mindset at all. how can you feel good about yourself for hurting others and shoving the blame on them. dont get it. (3/3)
i KNOW what they hear is "if someone is upset because i hurt them due to not trying to manage my symptoms its their fault" and that's horrifying. i have adhd and have never forgotten an important promise or date. because i RECOGNIZE that symptom and accommodate myself for it(2/?)
tired of folks on the internet using their mental illness to absolve themselves of all accountability. every time i see one of those posts that go just because u have X mental illness and exhibit Y symptoms doesnt make you a bad person, other people should be understanding (1/?)
found out a coworker was quitting and my manager was like im surprised u didnt know its been like a month and u two are already so close and im over here like sir im an extrovert with adhd im not close to anyone here im just Funny and Dont Shut Up
lrt yeah this thread does accurately about sum up where i stand
me five minutes later while busily working: i want my gender to be every detective. the look every single detective has? want that as my gender
@VIRTUALPETHELL damn i wish i had that as a career path :/
currently its: Please Do Not Refer To Me As Female and that's literally all i have
soon as i figure out what the fuck my gender is it's all over u motherfuckers
now i have these bitches gay. good for them. good for them on loop as i Thought About Saiouma
