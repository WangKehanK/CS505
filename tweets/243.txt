@bardiercarter *logs off*
@VDiaz004 Stop. I‚Äôm triggered
@sbachman_ Put on a parka
I just woke my pup up from a nightmare, and he has the audacity to look at me like I‚Äôm the bad guy
After this semester, I‚Äôve reached the ‚ÄúI need a vacation‚Äù level where sitting at the beach in the rain is perfectly acceptable
I‚Äôm still triggered, like Eugene couldn‚Äôt cut off Rapunzel‚Äôs hair at a more reasonable length..
How do I always end up going back to school with more than I left with
So what exactly are you supposed to say when someone knocks on the bathroom door..  *asking for a friend
@antoniofoles Really..just your masters... ugh don't talk to me unless it's a doctorate program üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just got a henna tattoo with permanent ink and a tattoo gun, that's how they work right?
Let's all say a silent prayer for all the bid days girls who will continue to find glitter on them until graduation day
@DunkinDonuts you call these both Caramel iced coffees, I don't think so... https://t.co/gYBmRVNUKz
@antoniofoles The swamp
All these kids complaining about 'back to school'...the real struggle starts when you have to pay $15,000 to go 'back to school'
@me   ...and a million dollars  ...and to already be a Physical Therapist  ...and another dog https://t.co/mvvRANHx4Y
That moment every Sunday when you realize you didn't accomplish anything you planned to do over the weekend
Break our streak, I'll break your neck

@CaseyNeistat when are you moving?

@tyrahhh_ that class slaughtered me
You know it's senior year when your teacher hits you with a pop test
263 days until graduation, but who's counting
The worst part of working with food is when a customer hands you wet money..
How is knowing how to compare fractions going to make me a better Physical Therapist?
It's dumb that after 4 years of college a test like the GRE decides your future
All I really wanna do is have a tiny house and travel the country
Still not accepting that I'm going into my last semester of classes
so blessed rn https://t.co/a8eVfgQc9w
okay but same  https://t.co/AWtdJvupw5
Lol @ me for entering in to be on Family Feud
Correction, they have 16 kids
Did I mention they had 12 kids
Gotta love it when that one family at the beach decides to sit right in front of you
#blessed for surviving taking 12 hours this summer
Nothing like eating a smushed sandwich at the beach to bring back those childhood memories
Bless my grandma for bringing mimosas to the beach
