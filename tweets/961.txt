Im really just depressed a lot of the time now, nothing ever really makes me truly happy and free.
@dropdeadrandall You’re my world G ♥️ https://t.co/Ic3FbA2pJH
I deserve the world. Nothing less.
My handsome boyfriend hasn’t given me a besito in like who knows how many hours, i want compensation for my suffering 🥺
@chattedor If you know what county you were born in you can go to that county’s government center and go to records and ask for a copy of your birth certificate they should have it
@chattedor Oh gosh i mean if its not that sag moon is a bit scary, astrology is a bit difficult to understand at first but it gets easier, your birth time should be on your birth certificate
@chattedor Dude im a sag sun scorpio rising and aquarius moon
My boyfriend still hasn’t asked me to be his valentine AND ITS ALREADY FEBRUARY
My boyfriend made me start my period and now im mad at him because he’s sleeping instead of rubbing my tummy for me 🙂
@rtkalexbby Im not use to having to ask for absolutely everything especially after I’ve been told it was ok to do so. You know that im overly sensitive and you need to watch how you say things to me sometimes cause YOU KNOW i overthink everything.
@rtkalexbby @chattedor @isatripppp You made me feel like shit about eating. Fuck off
@rtkalexbby @chattedor Fuck off
@chattedor @isatripppp She just came home and i told her about it and she said “oh don’t worry about it i have more (:” HE MADE ME FEEL SOO CRAPPY FOR NO FLIPPING REASON 😭😞
@chattedor It was beans... the left over was beans ugh idk he just made me feel so guilty about it cause “he was raised differently”
@chattedor She’s not here its 1:30 pm i havent eaten and my boyfriend was busy playing cod and I specifically told him i was hungry and i was gonna make something and he comes out after ive made my food and said “i think my mom was gonna make something with that, you should’ve asked first”
Am I supposed to ask my boyfriends mom if i can make myself breakfast and if i can use the leftovers she has? When she’s said to look in the fridge if im ever hungry 😞🥺
@AmericanoBruce thank you sm 🥰🥰
I might get a new (new for me) car in the next couple of days 😭 *crossing my fingers*
@bassdaddyethan I don’t know how this makes sense but it makes sense
@sadgirlsdub You’re literally my motivation to go to the gym pls keep posting gym pics 🥺
Me: you’re gonna find long hairs of mine in your ass one day and you’re gonna be ok w that My boyfriend: your hairs may be in my ass but my face is in yours
