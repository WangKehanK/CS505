@sean_esakov I have seen a few things here and there, but I just feel like it hasn’t been shared a lot on here? 🤷🏼‍♀️ usually when things like that happen I see it every other tweet, today I saw like two.
@SwizzyJ303 Ah thank you

My dad who has Alzheimer’s took my seatbelt from the front of the car and clicked it into his seat directly behind me. When I tell y’all I’m laughing so hard. 💀💀💀 He laughed too lmao, sometimes you just gotta laugh.
@zephanijong Hi I would miss your tweets. I know it might just be a small part of your life but I would miss your tweets, meaning i would miss you. But your tweets aren’t the only part of your life. You have other things to live for. You are enough, and you are loved.
