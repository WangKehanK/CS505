I’m sorry but there’s no valid reason to have a heart transplant in your 90’s.  Rockefeller did the same fucking shit.   Gets heart transplant, dies anyway
Also there was a pigeon sitting out in the parking lot all by itself this morning at 4am and one of the managers said poor things been there all night and wouldn’t move from that spot. She gave it water and when the next manager came in she caught it 🥺🥺
Why tf is it so hard to find art of poc elves for reference???  Like I see these people in my head I KNOW what I want them too look like but damn it would be so helpful to have a proper visual because from head to document is something I cannot do without being W o R D y
Whooooh someone spent their hard earned weed money at the depot yesterday. Could get high off this stack of 20’s
The fact that I can’t have children and in spite of never wanting them, it just hit me like a freight train. Why does it hurt so much? Why at almost 6 fucking AM? It’s too early for this shit.
Kinda wish I’d gotten cozy grove on the switch.... ah well.
If dresses don’t have pockets what’s the fucking point
Hell is inside my own head.
Just remembered I go back on the floor next week and I’m tryin real hard not to think I’d rather kms than do that.
More mysteries... I wonder who’s been vaping a weed pen in the bathroom
I wonder who smokes weed in this parking lot every morning.... mysteries abound
I would absolutely love to have the presence Baron does. Top tier cat.

Someone at work told me I looked like a firebird when I was outside sitting in the sunrise.
I deeply hope that schools still have the career classes.... I feel bad for the kid, but at the same time I’m sitting here laughing about it because who uses a half ripped piece of paper and two different pens and leaves it in book keeping a box. I’m nobody
Okay I don’t know who needs to hear it, but it apparently needs to be said. Please TYPE your letter of resignation, and use a FULL sheet of paper and PLEASE give it to a manager, not their ‘mailbox’  My manager just spent 20 minutes with me laughing about it.
Guess who’s a little office boy all week!! It’s me! 😊
The wretched basket holiday is upon us
No justice! No peeps!
I ask myself over and over what being mean to myself does for me and I can’t come up with an answer but I still keep doing it.
Who else enjoys drinking RAW FUCKING SUGAR at 6am. Oh boi it’s so fucking good. I feel like I’m choking on sugar cubes.
Rejection dysphoria is a hell of a drug

I wish I could make it illegal to play music in stores.. like. For real tho.
Oh boi! We got another one boys this time the waterway jam is in California lolol
Also. Vax shot number 2... if you feel any kinds of bad, stay home, sleep it off. I feel so much better today because of the decision I made yesterday.
Like, I’m not one to watch a music video, but damn son of that was hot.
The only difference from Gaga’s Judas and Nas X’s Montero is how much it pissed off both protestants and Catholics because of Montero’s use of symbolism that basically a big middle finger to the ‘you gays are going to hell’ rhetoric
I really love this resurgence of....satan loving? Protestant hate? Catholic guilt?  Whatever this is that makes the church lose its shit because some musician decide to use religious imegry
Maybe one day I’ll be able to return to my island....
My bones ache and my chest hurts 🙃
I’m tired of feeling so so alone.
@IScreamDice These are absolutely stunning! I’m so glad they came out for you 💜 fantastic job
I couldn’t have woken up street they had left??? In don’t want to deal with them
Ugggghhhhh I couldn’t fall asleep last night
This country pisses me off daily. It’s a wonder I’m still on this fucking site
Yona of the dawn is so good. I am lost in the sauce
Yeah! Another Saturday in America and the Waffle House is trending!!!!  I love the south😂😂 so much
I know it’s like a super dumb thing to want especially since I don’t do hair anymore, except mine own.... but I really want the Dyson supersonic hair dryer.... it’s so pretty. It work so good.
Got shit for luck ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Honestly if y’all were trying to stop scalpers you would have made more of a product you knew was going to sell out in literally less than a minute.
I hate this fucking country. Couldn’t have done preorder no. We had to do hunger games style bullshit and I’m so done with this shit!!!!!!!
They were fucking sold out the second it hit 9am
I feel like an animal prowling the online storefront of target 😑 Only country that makes getting Amiibo cards like the hunger games, everywhere else let you preorder.
I am trying to remember how to breathe
@EVERYTHINGDICE @gghemorrhage looooook, it’s like looking into mini galaxies! ☺️
I’m not even angry. I’m sad. I’m sad for this state, for this county, for this town.... industry and money is going to kill everything I love about this state and we’re all going to be swallowed up by the concrete jungle. I hate this.
I hope that land developer and his skeezy attorney know no peace. Ever.
There’s an Irish pub in this plaza called Paddywagon
@trxyland Gray definitely makes the color pop more but they’re both super cute!
So, I’m trying my damnedest not to linger on this thought, but it really does just make me said. Cause at the end of it... I’ve been watching cancer kill a coworker through his devolving handwriting... for years. And it just dawned on me because today it was worse than usual.
DeSatan really wants me to launch him into the stratosphere doesn’t he. Fucking. “Oasis of freedom” get the fuck outta here. We’re the countries largest hot spot thanks to you! Tourism and the literal droves of northerners moving into this state is gunna kill us.
