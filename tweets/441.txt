Females investigative skills are actually really impressive and should be allowed on resumes as a skill
@sierra289brown Friend has it. He said it was rough for 3-4 days with a fever. Now it’s uphill and he’s waiting for taste / smell to come back
2012-2016 Flume was my shit. The best shit. All day everyday.   Everything after that has been disappointing and it actually hurts my heart 😅🥺 https://t.co/cymDzHos0i
I need to feel bass again 🥴 https://t.co/scguXrrIM9
Petition to make @savmontano a co host on @callherdaddy w the queen daddy @alexandracooper pls and thx 🥺
@Johnny__Munoz Literally me at EDCO experiencing Slander for the first time 😂🥺
@21JAI18 “Just cause you big dont mean you can fight”  I’m gonna stop there cause it’s too much for someone talking to JOSE 😂 like my mind can’t grasp the conversation because im too distracted by that statement
I, among millions globally, demand that John Mattingly, Brett Hankison, &amp; Myles Cosgrove are arrested &amp; CHARGED with manslaughter and negligence regarding Breonna Taylor. The world is watching @GovAndyBeshear @djaycameron @DanielCameronAG @RepJohnYarmuth @RandPaul @senatemajldr
I am whole again ❤️ https://t.co/ImKDr8No3V
@SevenLionsMusic @SlanderOfficial tomorrow my hubs comes home from a 212 day deployment and today I’m blaring First Time throughout my house literally happy crying ✨🌻🌞🦋  We got to experience y’all live for the first time right before he left last year!!
I get my husband back tomorrow.  That is all.
@AllTimeEDM I didn’t help bc I did all 3.   You can’t play my heart like that making me choose 🤧
Reproducing is wild.   Not sure what I’d do without my best little friend 💞 https://t.co/f8cSwUG97d
I wonder how much it would be to book a private @Excision show tho.   Like can you do that? In your backyard? 😂
When you do a countdown do you count the day you’re on? Cause I don’t.   So I have 2 days 🥴
@ariellynn987 Same dude. I finished that shit today and just cried 😂
I was not prepared for this @13ReasonsWhy 🥺😭
Sorry for the constant tweets but it’s all I can think about because I only have 5 more sleeps alone 🥵
But I’d rather have it now and kill it within a few days instead of the day before he comes home so I guess I’m thankful 🤷🏻‍♀️
Lmaoooo I THINK I HAVE STREP 😂💀 5-6 ish days before hubs comes home.   This deployment can fuck off.
@KimKardashian lol I would not decline https://t.co/ezACL5pyzl
Really can’t actually believe this time next week I’ll have my husband back in my home

And you know what, I ain’t ever said a god damn word but this thread spoke to me and gave me the balls to do so.   If you ever need someone who understands, I’m here. We’re never alone.

What the FUCK @notgrayman https://t.co/ThaSGaaqnu
Do you ever panic for a moment when you get the floss stick stuck in your teeth
Honestly love seeing all the decade challenge pics of girls who were younger than me in school that I’ve known for so long. Like elementary when we were all babies. The glow up is so real and y’all are beautiful
@kaciegrado The fucking GLOW UP
She just walks to me now and randomly gives me long hugs. She doesn’t even know how much I need that https://t.co/QBWWzpSYOB
Just anxiously awaiting for a message from hubs. Today’s day 5. It’s fine. https://t.co/932T9R9n8n
@stoned2thabones @heysammyk @notgrayman this will be you when you’re freed
@kimjaeger93 DO YOU REMEMBER THIS NIGHT 😂 https://t.co/sArZW8SyLB
My heart is heavy for the 750 soldiers about to deploy all of a sudden, and possibly the 4000 more. Praying for your safety, and praying for your families back home. God speed.
Holy fucking shit https://t.co/I6taFeQrxl
I listen to Cover Me Up @MorganWallen multiple times a day and idk if it’s helping with my hubs being deployed, breaking my heart more, or a little bit of both ¿
@pazpaz Slander, Rezz, and Excision tied for my #1: all at EDCO
