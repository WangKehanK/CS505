@minakimes mina, I’m not saying you’re wrong, but you have to consider that some people are spending significantly more than others. My buddy is a promoter at clubs and had his club sold out on tables (min 10k + bottles) at the NBA all star game in Chicago. Now multiply by dozens of clubs
I honestly don’t think the Patriots could go wrong with Justin Fields or Trey Lance. Leaning Lance cause he has a higher ceiling but Fields is great in his own right and could realistically start week 1.

@Jared_Carrabis this catcher is the worst catch a ball in the dirt for once
@barstoolWSD that was just pure filth no one is laying off that
@len0killer tommy boy you’ve got the homosexual community up in arms today, sounds like another good day at the office
@PeteBlackburn (dubinsky was right)
@alexspeier There are several successful starters that throw two pitches 90% of the time early career Masterson and Chris Archer come to mind.   Houck seems to have the stuff to get away with it, sending him to the minors would mean that the Sox aren’t playing their best 26 I think.
@Run__EMC Makes sense after the opt out. Yeah he’s going to overpower some guys if he only has to worry about once through the lineup... still long term a starter I think
@Run__EMC are they gonna bullpen him all year?
@barstoolcarl That was my go to Walgreens when I lived down there, there were always so many weird items in the alley behind it
@sad_ex_machina @TaylorHaasePGH @DanPensFan17 zero chance it’s frederic considering that tanev got wrecked in a fight vs him in frederic’s first nhl game. most likely clifton, he was the one who took tanev’s helmet off mid play

@PFF_Brad @PP_Rich_Hill @fbgchase @JimmyJohnson @Jason_OTC If you think that the difference between #3 and #12 is the ~90th pick then there’s something wrong with your draft chart. The others make sense
(Atlanta should run to the podium and steal Sewell at #4)
Kinda feels weird to see a trade up well before draft day.  Shades of 2016 where the Rams and Eagles traded up to #1 and #2 weeks before the draft to get Goff and Wentz.   This tells me that #1 and #2 are pretty much set with Lawrence and Wilson so SF has their choice after. https://t.co/muDGouMSWb
how did the bears think this tweet was gonna go... https://t.co/hH0wk9Wt0A
@barstoolWSD only went to one free class there a while back but I had a different gym membership so I didn’t go back. Solid experience though pretty structured workout. Probably 80% of the group was girls 20-30
@littleidiotgirI Probably went to this place 250 times during hs lunch or walking home when i was at newton north. Absolutely preposterous setup for a supermarket but we just accepted it as normal.

I’m sorry, but the Bears signing Andy Dalton to be their new starter is objectively hilarious
With Hunter Henry, Jonnu Smith, Nelson Agholor, and Kendrick Bourne now signed there is no huge need to prioritize those positions in the draft.  Setting the stage for the Pats to trade up and pick their choice of who falls behind Lawrence and Zach Wilson.
@len0killer Actually apparently she’s Persian. I retract my statement (but not really)

@RacismInventor don’t lie you’ve had work done
@KeaganStiefel Feel that. Mostly I’m an “athleticism and we’ll figure it out later” evaluator where you can teach scheme. You can get Jamie Collins and also Taylor Mays. I loved DK Metcalf... but also Dorial Green-Beckham.  I go athleticism &gt; production/fit LBs cause of Belichick but we’ll see
@KeaganStiefel You can knock him for not being able to play MIKE but he is what people are looking for in the modern day LB position as a plus athleticism and cover guy. Similar to Duggar honestly.
It would honestly be hilarious if Mac Jones turns out better than Jalen Hurts AND Tua https://t.co/iQhWSZ9I96
@Billyhottakes ask portnoy if you can use buzz but instead of the next gme search the internet for pft mannerisms

Let’s not turn Vanderbilt into “could alabama beat the browns”  Rocker and Leiter would have ERAs in the 5s or above in AA right now... Vanderbilt wins maybe 20% of its games in AA and that’s generous https://t.co/8xUTcgV88R

@thenamesbdwy responsible joshy stocks
torn between the reason being the patriot way behind belichick/patricia and the utter lack of offensive skill talent but not good either way https://t.co/mNdzArV0Xp
@JuMosq Goff is a league average QB at a position starved for talent. How does it cost so much to get out of 43 million in guarantees.  Goff in a 2 year commitment at ~franchise tag money can’t be that underwater
I lied. Goff’s roster bonus of 15.5 million in 2022 is guaranteed. So a 2 year commitment for Detroit.  Still don’t think that deal is that bad. Goff isn’t a top tier QB but that’s market value for an average starting QB in the most starved for talent position in the league
Weird trade for LA. Goff’s contract isn’t even that bad whoever trades for him gets Goff on a cap hit of 28.15 million in 2021 and only $10 million guaranteed beyond next year.  Lions essentially get Goff at franchise tag cost with little commitment past this year. That’s not bad https://t.co/TyAg8RkJZz
