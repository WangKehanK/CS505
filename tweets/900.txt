@TappGod @Adam__1K @Squeaxs He’s Mexican bum
@TappGod @DreamerGCC I gotta keep it real I cringed so hard
I heard of this really good call of duty player named llama2god and I don’t even really play games like that anymore but word on the street he can snipe the balls off an anorexic fly from across the map I think he could really benefit optic
@christianv75 @Zirksee Dak won 1 in 3 trips and doesn’t have an mvp....
@Chrisvas77 @Zirksee Lamar and allen have as many playoff wins as Dak with less years in the league fuck out of my mentions
@ndndbx16 @Zirksee Just pointing out 1 of the many flaws that have been exposed
@Zirksee Dak ain’t top 7 get lost  He doesn’t pass Rodgers Brady Russell Watson Lamar mahomes or josh Allen
@ndndbx16 @Zirksee Dlaw had 6 sacks on the season getting top 5 d end money get lost dudes a scrub
@Zirksee “Burnt every once in a while” he was giving up over 100 ypg to whoever he was guarding on average all season.... he could get better but he didn’t have a good season at all. But to be fair no one did for the cowboys defense
@tbhMolly Facts
24 hours of no power or heat finally restored. Took those dumbass people long enough
@abcDroid_ You’re stupid lmfao
@Rivuhh @TappGod ???? Browns showed what teams are gonna do next year. which is run away from him and double him. That’s what they did in the playoff game in the first half. (Also ignoring the fact Steelers offense put the defense on the field a lot more)
@TappGod @Rivuhh And I’m a Steelers fan so I’ll die on mine
@TappGod Around and TJ deserved the award this year AD shouldn’t even have been the runner up considering Xavian howard had a better year than Gilmore when Gilmore won the award. It was robbery
@TappGod I get that and I’m not denying AD is a better player and draws more attention especially being on the interior but TJ led or was up there in every category you can think of for defense even was 2nd amongst linebackers for passes defended it wasn’t just pass rushing it was all
@TappGod Get lost with that shit homie look at the stats https://t.co/CneH36AF2x
@liarblink23 @ggmartin1235 @BigOMitchell @EAMaddenNFL Nah I wouldn’t say that I’d say he’s asking for a casual experience when in reality the simple solution is as people would say “just get better and adapt”
@ggmartin1235 @EAMaddenNFL They do it’s called zone drops lmfao

@GorgoKnight https://t.co/8X5KFAEYT3
@xHarpo_ Lol what?
@Hidden819 Even if Ben probably wants to take deep shots frequently like he does every week and the cowboys defense is butter at defending them so I wouldn’t worry about that just would worry about getting vultured if he gets stopped at the 1
@Hidden819 Claypool it’s Dallas man
@TappGod It’s not a bad idea but you might need the points later if you tie with someone in your division for playoffs
@LlamaGod How bout them cowboys😂😂😂
@XYZinx Shout out
@XYZinx I haven’t watched since the chunin exams should I get back into it?
