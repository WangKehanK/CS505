So I've been listening to audiobooks on Audible since I have like eleven credits on it. I'm listening to Stephen King's The Shining and I'm hooked.
@8BitUltra God it would be a dream to have a vacation on mars as an old man. I mean I grew up reading and watching science fiction about that. To think that it will be possible within my lifetime is crazy to think about.
@AndrawnStudios Hope the best for you bud.

@jellyelous @Thetom5000 Yeah that's absolutely over the line. Honestly I think you should report these guys.
@ariwannii I would cry in pain.
@Protodude I would love that! In my opinion these designs makes them look more robotic while still looking enough like the original design to be recognizable.
@HihiSugarCub Commitment is scary.
