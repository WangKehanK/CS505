Can‚Äôt believe we used to pay $1.29 per song on ITunes!
Bothers me bc things are going to become ever more expensive than they already are! 16 yr old doesn‚Äôt need 15/hr. Wanna make more money work for it like my parents and grandparents did when they came from Italy w nothing. They worked have everything they want and live good lives! https://t.co/4mB2jvqMD4
Minimum wage job is made to introduce ppl to the work force. Not made to provide for a family. If you want more money find a manual labor job that pays good or invest your money into stocks and such! I don‚Äôt want to pay $30 for a pizza. Work hard and your money will come!! https://t.co/VVN02M5ZIG

Not a pretty one at all but I‚Äôll take it. More of a bad game by Pittsburgh than a good game by Baltimore. To many dropped passes. https://t.co/wFlufhiqIq

@JoeGlock730 @Realrclark25 They moved the Steelers - Washington game to monday
This is a complete joke at this point. Just keep bending over backwards for the ravens some more. Ravens should either play tomorrow or forfeit. Simple as that. https://t.co/88LjXZ394j
Only college will still make you feel stressed while on break.

Minimum wage job isn‚Äôt supposed to. It‚Äôs supposed to introduce you to working to later find a real job. https://t.co/3uXctUwzrb
