back to AOT just for a little while #NewProfilePic https://t.co/ERrRXhC1OR
@paytonlemons i feel like as a society (omg we live in a society) that’s kinda already normalized with or without the consumption of violent media as a child. like we’re naturally attracted to commotion, y’know? at least that’s how i see it. but i def get what you mean
@paytonlemons that’s true yeah. the definition isn’t really clear. how do YOU define it?
@paytonlemons i don’t think exposure to violent media at a young age is healthy at all, but hasn’t this specifically been categorically disproven?
Attack on Titan is now over and i’m SAD
@Sk3tchyM3 @101Fillies iirc even Golden Freddy’s jumpscare in FNAF 2, like the one where his disembodied head moves towards the screen, isn’t just an image file - the perspective warps as it nears you as if it were a 3D model
while Eren is definitely my favorite character in AoT by quite a bit, i feel like i’m prolly most similar or at least relate the most to Jean https://t.co/xmLIIiNzdR

@Imaoamber bread boxes are classist
after opening, bread goes:
bread should not be refrigerated, y’all are psychotic
@neutralnikhotel please....
there’s a ton of Attack on Titan Tiktoks that grace my for you page but a lot of them use this really annoying audio that’s a pretty mid mashup of Dua Lipa’s Levitating and My War from the S4 OP and it’s just so ear grating
