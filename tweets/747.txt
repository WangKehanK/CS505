This is the freedom I didn’t realize I needed until I was out. It never seemed possible to thrive. I’ve been simply surviving for years of my life and for the first time I’m truly thriving. On top doing something I love. God is so good
I have never had in my entire life. I have never been in an environment that I could call my own, that I didn’t have the be someone else’s person, be the caretaker, and fake being happy in a heavily toxic household.
In full transparency, moving to LA I truly had the intention to instantly relapse into all the dangerous stuff I’ve done to myself. Now with almost being a week here I don’t feel that urge. Because I wanted control. I craved control. I now have that freedom and control that
My TeacherD: “When you were 19, you subliminal messaged your boss with songs” Me: yes.
I was almost misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and adhd, by two psychologists. It took two years for a third opinion to diagnose me with depression w/mixed features. It’s unfortunately so common, and as patients we really don’t know until a good doctor comes along. https://t.co/fmoQpeHyx0
I just finished listening to the entire #DWTDTAOSO and it is one of the most amazing albums I’ve heard in my life. Thank you @ddlovato for sharing your truth, your journey. For your strength, humility and vulnerability. I’m so proud of you!
I just wanna thank God for bringing me the music that I need to hear at the time in my life when I need it most.
@voskyddl I haven’t processed this part or any of the par honestly of the music video. So many people don’t realize how huge this is for someone who survives trauma and a near death experience. I’m so inspired by her strength and vulnerability
Melon Cake
I.C.U really got me in tears.
I just finished watching the music video and I don’t think I’ve ever seen an artist be this raw and vulnerable with their music. I don’t cry at many things but I’m left speechless with tears in my eyes. I’m so proud of you @ddlovato #DWTD https://t.co/uFNRwjkHEN
Ive been taking Shadow to therapy with me for the last few weeks because my anxiety has been really bad. He is so good and doesn’t leave my side. He’s become the best therapy cat! Now he’s traveling with me to LA for school as my ESA. 17yrs and he’s still here. I love him so much https://t.co/2mGvrNrTnx
I’ve missed them so much! I can’t wait for the episode tomorrow!!! https://t.co/Eqzx4lMiTp
Do you ever just take a moment, sit back and wonder what else @meganhilty gonna do next? I swear I’ve heard her sing in every range, in so many genres of music and I’m amazed every time. Talk about being a rare gem of a talent. Is there anything she can’t do?!
And Im still not perfect. I still struggle, but I try my best to take it one day at a time and make sure I have a support system that helps me stay on track and healthy. I love what I do and I’m glad I’m growing mentally and professionally. I def. don’t sing like that anymore lol
And if I told this kids that she’d be in LA &amp; NYC majoring in musical theatre and doing what she loves I wouldn’t have believer me. It took me 8yrs to truly jump back into that spark and work towards what I’m passionate about. It’s never to late. Time and hard work truly heals
I found a video of me auditing when I was 14. Let’s talk about growth. This was at the beginning of my severe decline into anxiety &amp; depression. I stopped doing anything that brought me joy. I didn’t work on myself and fell into my own addictions. It’s been almost 10yrs https://t.co/PFSsyQstgv
I miss the way she would lick my tears away and pounce on me when I was sad. I miss when she would accidentally lick up my nose or French me because her tongue was so long. I miss how she would pounce down from the bed when she knew I was awake. I miss her
I’ve been missing my Lily so much lately it hurts 💔 nothing can ever replace you Lilybug🐞 https://t.co/6v1sBvBJZB
HSM3 was the first movie I saw in theatres when I moved to the mainland. Simpler times https://t.co/FEVUX3MWAB
It’s my last weekend in Washington! I’m so happy I’m leaving this chapter of my life.
I’ve crying at random things all day because my brain is overwhelming. Ironically my Music Theatre teacher assigned me a song called “Feelings” and I feel attacked
Adding to this tweet today. She basically never gives 100% to anyone for participation. Because we aren’t perfect. Literally we are learning a combo in class and we try our best. This isn’t our final. It’s not meant to be perfect. Nothing is perfect.
@JessicaVosk I love therapy and have been in therapy for almost a decade. People are so surprised when I talk so openly about therapy. There’s still so much of a stigma towards therapy even when it’s such an amazing tool for people to learn about themselves and heal. It’s definitely saved me.
Like what kind of teacher does that. Punish a student because they struggle to do a movement because of an injury?! It’s only the third week of the semester and I don’t like my teacher at all
Also proceeds to tell me how important it is for me to take care of myself. 🙃 literally I communicated ahead of time, told her that I can do the whole dance except bend down, which is literally 30 seconds at the end. Yet punish me when I verbally asked for modifications
I’m not looking forward to my dance class tomorrow since my teacher lowered my participation due to the fact I couldn’t perform certain movement due to my back which I asked for modifications for  then instead  told me to stand and watch.
“It's just a little red wine, I'll be fine Not like I wanna do this every night I've been good, don't I deserve it? I think I earned it, feels like it's worth it In my mind”. This hit soooo hard. What I dealt with as a teen and still struggle with as an adult. This whole song tbh
AHHHHH @ddlovato #DWTDTONIGHT https://t.co/hNHVTFtRyV
@StephanieJBlock Now I’m really curious and want to hear defying gravity a whole step up.
God works in mysterious ways. Free housing y’all if he’s telling me I could get the job. I move on campus next weekend https://t.co/vxTMXpMzOG
@YouTube @ddlovato When are the last two episodes going to be released? I have YouTube Premium
I need the two next episode of DWTD on YouTube now. I hate waiting
She Used to be Mine and then transitioning into Everything Changes. Don’t know why Everything Changes makes me cry when I hear it. I blame Shoshana Bean for taking me on a beautiful emotional rollercoaster. It’s been 2yrs and I’ll never be the same after seeing her in Waitress https://t.co/B6TTFH882E
Im not emotionally prepared to watch this tomorrow https://t.co/4MqIr4mXcg
When I’m in NYC in the fall this is the first show im gonna see! https://t.co/TIBtco4Ed4
Finally getting into Wandavision. Sooo good
At me, mouthing “call me”. He always came down to my department and kept staring me down. Then one day I never saw him again. Maya random memory of the day
This one time this creepy coworker who gave me his number and said “don’t you work too hard”. He worked in a different department, didn’t know him. I took the number waited for him to leave and then I started laughing because I was so uncomfortable. Weeks later he kept staring -
First covid shot done!
I can’t believe it’s my last two weeks in Washington 😱 LA here I come. As Elsa says “the past is in the past...” https://t.co/Q4qbkeOr4Q
@hezvato You’ve literally been here with me through this whole journey for the past 8yrs! 🥺💚 love you heather
and my mentor literally is so supportive and so reaffirming that I truly deserve the amazing things that have came my way the past year. Y'all im so grateful
My therapist told me how I'm truly thriving and living in my purpose for the first time in my life. 😭❤️
@MakealaEddings3 girl same.
When people in your life refuse to take a covid test so I can say goodbye to them before I move. They’ve also been sick for a month and still won’t go to the doctor or get tested 🙃 So they don’t fucking care about saying goodbye to me. I’m not coming back home anyway.
There’s literally no way you can justify a mans motive for killing 6 women. “He had a bad day” my ass. He went to multiple massage parlors, had sexually motivated, hateful intentions, and killed these women. https://t.co/YBqwnZsZuO
This is absolutely heartbreaking https://t.co/mek7p6Fxra
22 songs. My heart won't be able to handle it
This album is gonna win grammy's.
APRIL 2nd!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm going to cry.
Dancing With The Devil: The Art of Starting Over I'm crying
@voskyddl I haven’t gotten an invite ugh
Y’all on the phone with the vet. When she said “buh-bye” I legit waved at my phone goodbye. This is where quarantine has brought me
Taking my fur family to the vets give me the worst anxiety. I don’t want them to go to the vet and never leave. I miss my Lily.
I’m sooooo excited!!! https://t.co/41L7U7MeI6
@voskyddl Or at least the lead single with the documentary
@voskyddl I have a feeling that her album and the documentary are coming out at the same time
@CMONDOMINIQUE I listened to this song all the time when I was in high school
When I got the $600 stimulus you didn’t take a extra week to deposit it. 🙃 https://t.co/hcPpzcwB0L
I literally can’t believe I forgot. I had all week to do it, she literally asked us the same question in class. This week has fuxking sucked.
Why do teachers grade get to know you papers because I literally forgot to do it and now I’m minus 20points and am failing the class. It’s literally the first week and I was to pull my hair out. It’s literally just answering questions about me. Ughhhhhh
Ah this!!! https://t.co/VSPAOPsA9y

Broadway better be back when I’m in school in New York this fall. I need to see Company and NEED to see @PattiLuPone. Now that’s a dream

My Music Theatre teacher: Being on time is late, being early is on time. Me: Finally my anxiety is useful for something. Punctuality
