Sometimes all you need is a little wine and a whole lot of Jesus
Our Lord is so faithful... Even when we don’t always see Him working in our lives, He still continues to work on our behalf. When the answer is “no” sometimes those are the biggest blessings of all ❤️ “I’m gonna see a victory, for the battle belongs to you Lord”
Absolutely https://t.co/YyKRoArxvv

@Nathan_Lee21 Oh believe me, the student section let them know how much we did not approve of their calls. Like blatant ignorance about calls that were very obvious.
@Nathan_Lee21 I don’t think those refs would know what pass interference is if it was right in front of them... oh wait 🙃
@Nathan_Lee21 HA take that!

The older I get the more I realize just how many shallow interactions people have, and that I’ve also had in the past.
