Im lowkey tired of people and they attitudes.. ALL AROUND.. Like I caught you doing something take the blame and shut the fuck up.. Tired of people going off on somebody cause they in the wrong and got caught

Finally 21 🤩💸
2 weeks till my 21st bday and im still childish lol
Im sick of niggas pushing over my feelings like they dont matter.. Yeah im a man but i feel too.. Im so over it.. I tried to be positive but so many factors tryna pull me back into my old habits
People tend to get stuck or caught in past vices,problems, or issues.. Yes its normal to take some time out to focus on these issues WHEN THEY HAPPEN.. After they happen you turn it into a lesson and bring positivity back.. Move on not down
If your circle is not making you uncomfortable when it comes to growth they are putting you in a cage.. We reaching our goals and putting positivity into the world all 2020 💫🚀 Its a new decade Make a change in someone’s life!
