I am CRYING https://t.co/w0mcJqiXDi
@Estus_Abbeyy I’m trying to know who I don’t like since you don’t like her 👀
Clay went into work at 5 this morning and doesn’t get off until midnight. I hate it because I know he’s worn out but I appreciate the hard working man he is. 🥺❤️
@marshlar_p I say the same about you 🥵🔥

@Estus_Abbeyy What the actual hell!!! I will personally rearrange someone’s face on your behalf.
If you have a job that you love, be thankful. I dread going to mine every single day.
I real deal don’t understand the hype over Snapchat “streaks”. Some of y’all act like it’s the end of the world if you lose a streak. Imagine a social media app being that important. 🥴
@Estus_Abbeyy Aight imma blow your phone up 😂
I need more friends that I can just send random TikToks to
This makes me sick. Charge these sorry wastes of space with murder and throw away the key. https://t.co/vhiPORCBZg
@marshlar_p I want my baby to have a unique name, but it ain’t gonna be to where I can’t even spell it right and no one can pronounce it 🥴😂
@marshlar_p Right!! Got my head hurting over here 🤕
I’m gonna throw up https://t.co/uaEQ51413Q
I do too 😂😂 especially garlic powder. I can find a reason to put it in anything https://t.co/NoAgaGCNdm
@Estus_Abbeyy Same 🥺❤️
@Estus_Abbeyy Oh but you are perf 🤩
Some of you think you’re perfect and it has y’all looking dumb 😕
Broooooo 😂😂😂 https://t.co/cU1KtNxddU
I feel like I’ve gotten so behind with wedding planning since all this virus mess started 😩
Tyga being on TikTok is the best thing ever
I’m real deal blessed that I get to marry my bestfriend. One good thing about him not being able to work due to the virus is all the time we’ve got to spend together lately and boy has it reminded me just how close we are!! Always laughing and just living life together. 🥰
He asked me to put $1000 in savings 😩😂 https://t.co/5FEtX9vZ0M
But aye, if anyone’s hiring after this, lemme know. Ya girl don’t wanna stay at the hospital https://t.co/aRkoUyCGvf
I’m real deal mad they cut our hours but I can’t say it won’t be nice going home at 2 instead of 6
@WhiteheadMarisa Me either girl!
Some girls are so freaking disrespectful it’s ridiculous 😂😂😂
👀👀👀 https://t.co/or2BH4MZJe
And I also work in the ER 😩
It’s a bad time to have anxiety. Ever since all of this virus mess hit the US, I’ve been a basket case.
2020 feels like we transported to a different world tbh
@Estus_Abbeyy No matter how long we go without seeing each other (life of being adults) I’m always here. ❤️
@Estus_Abbeyy I am SO happy for you and support you no matter what. Do what’s best for you and yours always!!

I think the one thing most conservatives and all liberals can agree on is their dislike for this idiot right here. 😂😂 https://t.co/b3eRF3710R
Had my eyebrows threaded for the 2nd time yesterday and it hurt 10x worse than the 1st time 😩
I know @Estus_Abbeyy best be following me back. 🥴
@K_rob27 Now you know good and well you’d be more upset when one of us cleaned because it wouldn’t be the way your OCD butt likes things cleaned 😂😂😂
Folks need to mind their business anyway. Always got something negative to say. I know for a fact you’re happy!! Maybe nervous, but definitely not upset about it. https://t.co/AWDKkLf2Ax
@itsGambinOway Knot 😂 I’m screaming
@WhiteheadMarisa Same!! At first she was alright. But you can tell she doesn’t really care for him and after him keeping her tonight I’m convinced he likes the drama 😂
I see why none of Victoria’s relationships ever last. She literally does not have the ability to have a serious conversation without blowing up. #Bachelor2020 #BachelorNation
@brittanydodgen_ @shelly_mullinax @LukeBryanOnline @MorganWallen @LukeBryanOnline @MorganWallen !!!!!!
I’ve only drank 2 and I’m buzzeddd
Cabo’s margaritas will have you feeling like a light weight 😂😂😂
Mykenna after getting sent home 10 mins after he decided to keep her #BachelorNation https://t.co/3biTcgblw5
SEND TAMMY HOME #BachelorNation #Bachelor2020
Bye Victoria. 👋🏼 #BachelorNation #Bachelor2020
We get to taste test food for the wedding on Sunday and I’m excited 🤪
Well I do this too so count a white girl in. 😂 I’m too lazy to put waters up and I don’t like them cold. https://t.co/zXlRR9VaF0
OH MY GODDDDD SHE DIDNT 😂😂😂 I’m crying https://t.co/CaX9eKXHQd
@alexedenxx https://t.co/oGDqhcyLBh
And I typically don’t use public restrooms unless I’m at work. At work, there’s a single bathroom and literally no one knocks :)
And yes, I lock the door every time. But it still ticks me off. Like are you trying to see someone on the toilet? 😂
If you’re someone who doesn’t knock on a public restroom door, or really any restroom, before trying to open the door.. you’re scum and I hate you.
Y’all really using a man and his daughter’s death to compare presidents? Whether you’re for or against either of these people, wtf is wrong with you? Drop the politics for 2 damn seconds. Y’all disgust me https://t.co/5GMpajCUVg
I haven’t been big on ball since I stopped in 9th grade but everybody loves Kobe. The whole world is shook. I still can’t believe it. Rip to Kobe, his daughter, and everyone else on that helicopter. 🥺
We have our venue. Can’t wait to marry my bestfriend in September. 😍 #DawsonIDo
I’m cryn 😂😂😂 some of y’all girls are stuck up and I see why you can’t keep a man https://t.co/x3oHLlPiIp
Lol i shattered the back glass of my phone. Go me
@K_rob27 Same ❤️
@K_rob27 😂😂😂😂😂 I’m crine
Looking at a wedding venue today 😍
If someone is in a committed relationship, it’s HIGHLY disrespectful to be all over other girls’ accounts liking their pics. But if someone’s single, I don’t think them liking a bunch of pictures means they can’t be serious or loyal in a relationship. This is reaching.
I mean if he’s single, he can do what he wants?? My man liked girls photos before we got together. But when we got together, that stopped immediately. Not because I made him. But because he was no longer interested in anyone else. He respects me. https://t.co/M863fgd7ZI
I know these beans already 🤪 https://t.co/n1zrJNqWEA
