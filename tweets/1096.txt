Happy 2nd birthday G. Hard to believe 2 years ago we were unsure if you were going to make it or not and here we are now. We love you so much ♥️ https://t.co/aZDsa2uFUA
@mdsykes7 Me the other day 😂
@thatfatkidnick https://t.co/ilAeAxGqwm
I fucking miss you dude 😭💙
There’s nothing worse then having to wear ear plugs your whole shift because when you get off everything still sounds muffled for awhile 🤣
@meganljones00 Only 12 more days for Garrett and I’m not ready to except that 😢😢
@sadesj4 Get off Friday morning at 8am and don’t have to be back to work till Monday night 8pm so it’s not to bad
@sadesj4 That’s been my schedule at almost all the jobs I’ve had besides the last one. So now it’s back to night shift at this one 😂
Starting graveyard 12’s tonight and I’m not excited 😂😂
@dillonnylander Some gokart racing would be sick
@dillonnylander Dude for real. We all gotta plan another weekend soon somewhere else
@dillonnylander I’m literally sore from it 😂😂
It’s only a little after 6:30 and I’m ready for bed 😂😴
Sunny days like today mean absolutely every set of blinds in the house are wide open 😎
I don’t know man if I watched someone do this to my catcher you’d catch a fastball straight to the elbow/back https://t.co/kVYzU3EoYH
I want to play baseball again 😒
@mdsykes7 I’ll take it 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣🤣
Being stuck at calebs is fine and all until him and Andrea take naps for 2 freaking hours and you get to sit there bored by yourself 😂😂
In case anyone was wondering snails can go to sleep for up to 3 years 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣
@BraunStrowman The Last Kingdom if you haven’t already?

@jmakayla95 Correction. Woke up twice 😂😂 falls asleep for a half hour and wakes up thinking you slept for 12 straight hours. I wish that’s how I left after a half hour of sleep
@jessicawon57 Okay but I thought he was going Ls like along time ago 😂😂 I didn’t know it was a 400 😅😅 I’ll see my way out
Makayla has literally never watched The Good Burger 🤯 we are now watching it because what the actual fuck
Get you a best friend that calls you to tell you he’s on his way to your house to drop off a can of chew cause he knows your out 🤣😎
@dillonnylander I tried the open palm method first and well... it started rattling more 😂😂 step two might be the fist
If I don’t find the rattling noise coming from my dash I’m deleting the whole fucking thing 😤🤣
@Lexa_Danyelle Might be on the center divider I’m not sure. Makayla saw it but I never did 😂
@Lexa_Danyelle Well if you go towards jack n the box apparently they’re big ass sign is in the middle of the road on Main Street 😂
@Lexa_Danyelle That’s so weird with how close you are to our house
@Lexa_Danyelle Not ours
I miss the mullet already 😂😂
