My boyfriend lowkey sick as fuck
I’m not even full time and I’m working 10 hour days every week, 5 hour days + work. ✨take me out to the back of the shed, shoot me in the back of the head ✨
I don’t know how the fuck people are managing school right now. I feel like I’m losing it every single day.

Troy was one of the first people I met when I moved to Bellingham. I wish I had gotten to know him better. Whenever I saw him though, he was so fun, so inclusive of everyone, and kind. His sister is organizing his funeral, anything helps. https://t.co/2a9cIovK9C
