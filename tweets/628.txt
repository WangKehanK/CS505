Videos of Asian Americans being spit on. Sprayed (Doused actually) in hand sanitizer and by disinfectants. Physical assaulted. Ridiculous. I stand against the hate towards Asian Americans. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/1VkAlIaTRn
Strong work this morning by all responding departments! Post from Seldon VFD on Facebook. https://t.co/NsW25hDqHj
Well tomorrow maybe interesting. May the odds be ever in your favor.
At the end is sacred cross (Palo pinto ems), city M329 , our two boxes.   Dublin left as we pulled in and the other city truck came in and we left the ER. Busy day! https://t.co/m91QZ7i2QQ
Was honored to be apart of Lancaster Fireman Brandon Peterson’s funeral today. Rest easy , brother. We’ll take it from here. https://t.co/QSBya80vuF
This is the truth behind covid. Hospitals aren’t doing some surgeries right now, hell, Comanche county EMS took a transfer to New Mexico to get someone to an open bed. I’m not worried about dying from COVID , I’m worried about anything else and not being able to get treated. https://t.co/BdYhOhLPrz

Myself and 4 others receives the Moderna vaccine today! https://t.co/HRyOWAqZoL
@collin_vaughn @finalmouse @sean_mintxn Oh man, those are dope.
Doesn’t anyone else find it odd that we were only getting $600? When millions and millions are going to other countries. As well as random research projects that have NOTHING to do with Covid?  Pres Trump is right to call for higher check to Americans and less to other counties.
I do feel bad cause everyone was just staring at her and her friends for a good 2 minutes. 😂
Lmao tonight at Chili’s a girl pressed the button and her tazer went off. The entire dining section was staring at her 😂. Meanwhile all of us EMS guys are like “ YO YOU GOTTA SAY CLEAR BEFORE YOU SHOCK EM”😂. Made the time waiting for our food better.
@KierstonU 🙏🏻
How to describe what it’s like sleeping at work ... https://t.co/KTrbdO2OIY
@laynev17 Yeah but you can’t help think that he has to feel slightly relieved? The weight he was carrying lifted a bit , and feeling like he won’t be as much of target in a sense. Kind of an odd way to look at it, I know. 🤷🏼‍♀️
To my fellow Republicans, don’t riot, don’t loot, carry on with life. If the time arises, we defend what is ours. However, until that time comes, we just carry on with life. https://t.co/W9fQwsonsf
As if we weren’t already interesting times, it’s about to get even more interesting 😂
The next couple months are gonna be rough😅😂. I think we’ll be okay though.
I got an ace? I’m impressed https://t.co/8dePad7FYq
@collin_vaughn and I are playing among us right now! If you would like to play, you’re welcome to!
Well , I made the switch to full time pc gaming. Gotta say, I love it so much more 😂😅. COD is so much more fun on PC https://t.co/cxV37JhqCy
@BaileyBootles About to have that easy affiliate 😂
Can’t wait till we get to watch a “de escalation professional” go into a volatile Domestic dispute. The key word is WATCH. Some of you dont fully understand that it’s not gonna work.
@the__snowflake_ It is surprising to say the least.
I’m always like “one more episode” and now it’s 1. I have to get up in 4 hours. 🤦🏻‍♂️
@Itsashlynnmarie that’s where we are at today. We can’t have a differing opinion more without screaming and violence.
Lock and load, boss https://t.co/UT9wYWo70i
If you know a medic or firefighter medic looking for a progressive and aggressive service... here you go! I grew up with this dept and have seen it grow. It is 100% one of the best fire depts to work for right now! https://t.co/AfgI3ytQkq
Everyone like “OHHHHHHH” like you just did something. 😂. Pitiful , really. https://t.co/Oqnk3TLgfC
Stop standing in the road? Let the cars past? Is it really that hard? Are people really this dumb? I don’t understand. https://t.co/4uGp70GBgg
lmao.  Yeah. Let’s send in a de-escalation counselor to a domestic violence call. Bet that will end REAL peacefully. https://t.co/Iel0iH53ix
Well, looks like I’ll be going to medic school sooner than I expected😂😅
@brettcuster580 I don’t even rodeo, but I 100% agree!
This gets more funny every time I watch it. 😂 https://t.co/e4Jb8IPwvA
@the__snowflake_ If you get this reference, we can be friends
@MrAirForce2013 I don’t really know if I could do better. However I do know how to move with a purpose. Train like you fight. Train hard and train smart. This not any of that
@the__snowflake_ Yikes
There is so much violence today. Where are we headed in the near future? It’s much to uncertain to say. I hope that we as Americans can reunite again. Even if we have different views.
@kylie_jordan13 That’s the problem though. So many protest turn to riots. People actually protest are being covered up and the true point isn’t making. I get that there’s has been way more bloodshed than ever needed. However if it’s only being met with more? Nothing is being solved.
@kylie_jordan13 Riots aren’t protesting. Sorry but that’s what I think. I am 100% for the protesting, it’s your 100% your right to. However what does destroying Business and inciting more violence solve? Violence met with violence only brings unneeded blood shed.
@the__snowflake_ I have 5 days off coming up sun-wed maybe we can play a few🤙🏽
@the__snowflake_ Idk, I haven’t seen it in awhile.
@the__snowflake_ @BaileyBootles Bruh. HC is only thing I play 😂.
@the__snowflake_ Y’all playing hardcore or core?
@the__snowflake_ @BaileyBootles BRUH THAT MAN GOT YEETED BY A CLAYMORE
I’ve spent the entire back half of this 48 hiding in my room.  😂
It’s amazing how quickly people realized what was happening. Situational awareness for yourself, your kids, etc is crucial. The dude shouldn’t have walked away tbh. https://t.co/MFuokyXUtu
A very iconic picture. At the bottom, you can see FDNY ladder 118 rolling towards the towers. This would be the last call every crew member on board would answer. https://t.co/ECwxawSZ41
@the__snowflake_ ATF watching like https://t.co/pMkYxXgdWr
I hope that tomorrow we can drop or differences for the day. Just tomorrow for the 2,606, the 343, the 60, and the 8 that we lost. Tomorrow , let’s drop for differences for the day , and remember.
@brownnshugaaa Hardly ever do officers make more than firefighters. Sometimes they make just a tad bit more than private ems. People want them to get a 4 year degree? It’s not worth the pay. “Nurses do it , so should cops” cops don’t make near as much as nurses most places.
I recently started watching the anime “Fireforce” and came to this conclusion.... This is what we thought firemen really did in second grade. 😂😂😂
@the__snowflake_ @blaine_bow 😭😭😭😭 I just wanna touch it
@the__snowflake_ @blaine_bow Fr tho. Cans , IR, aimpoint T2’s.  Sheesh
@the__snowflake_ 🤢
@the__snowflake_ @BaileyBootles @melcrepps That’s the best type of fun though 😂
@the__snowflake_ I’d be the fastest despite being the fatter MOFO up that sucker for some ammo 😂
@BaileyBootles I’ve seen lot of people do that. Usually they admit they are going for camos or a new gun. So it’s forgivable, sorta 🤷🏼‍♀️
#ripcayde Still one of the best trailers in destiny’s history. https://t.co/ihRYkiaGE5
Tornado warning has expired! Heavy flooding is possible, strong winds will remain! TURN AROUND DONT DROWN! https://t.co/JCThr36G67
SOUTH CENTRAL ERATH COUNTY, a tornado warning is in effect! Seek shelter immediately, as rotation has been observed!
There actually people that think we can have vaccine that will work quickly. We can’t even get the flu strain right. You’d be out of your mind if you get the vaccine if came out like next week. https://t.co/DXELKbPIbs
Sir, I think you maybe having a stroke... https://t.co/fHHiYgKP7B
THANK YOU. https://t.co/yU7J5BbJtk
Imma need @ParkerMcCollum to write a song instead of “hell of a year” to “hell of a day” 😂
Love seeing vollies out on a wreck wearing a shirt with the sides cut all the way out. Yikes.
@brownnshugaaa Sounds pretty R wordy to me
@the__snowflake_ Geezus Christ. He seems a bit triggered.
Guys, can we all agree that 2020 sucks, and be friends again?
YIBAMBE! Rip to the king. @chadwickboseman
If civil unrest actually makes it all the way to stephenville... Well it probably won’t. So that’s good I suppose.
Girls when they go to chili’s and always get the pasta. 😂 https://t.co/s7ReHbTWfn
Someone in Erath county paid for any first responder to eat at Little John produce today. Thank you so much to whoever you are.
Our country is literally so divided right now. The worst part is people are refusing to acknowledge it, and prepare for what could come of it. Life is gonna be hella interesting in a few months.
THOSE LAST 2 PICTURES😂😂😂 https://t.co/mQ6rpu32En
If you don’t have ammo, buy it now. Magazines? Buy them now. It’s only going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.
This providers probably feel so terrible you couldn’t even describe it. However, as more information comes out it will be interesting to see how the lawsuit plays out. Further more an ER doc told ems to stop all further efforts so. I’m hoping for the best on this one. https://t.co/WDIliVb1Ca
The world is over here Falling apart, and I’m over here watching Yu-Gi-Oh GX like: https://t.co/iaj4WYzGnn
Send out a prayer tonight for everyone down south effected by Marco and Laura. Gods speed the responders in the aftermath.
Out country is actually crumbling before our eyes. I’m legitimately worried what happens come Election Day. Will either side be able to accept the results? Or will our country go down in flames that night?
I would like to hope he actually a paramedic, other wise you know. Impersonating. Some people believe so much off of one video without looking into more. It’s sad. https://t.co/RCIDEw3tpl
@brownnshugaaa Careful , brother. They gone come out  after you next.
@brownnshugaaa Me to people screaming in my face https://t.co/GUoq3RV1uM
Pull firefighters , civilians and anyone else not fighting in streets out of Kenosha. It’s not worth it anymore.
