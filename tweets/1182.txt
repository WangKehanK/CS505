When I used to work at saxbys I wanted a night where we turned it into a dance club and everyone did espresso shots https://t.co/CEqq8wBa9C

For real though imagine someone asked you to make like 100 sandwiches in an hour and they were like "I'll pay you about 7 bucks for that"

Alright who hacked millersville to give us a virtual snow day
In my fav sociology professor's class, me and another girl were checking our emails, we had gotten news the school was closing for two weeks. We spent the whole rest of the class talking about what might come next. Didn't return to campus that semester. https://t.co/U1MFOKnMvZ

Life has just thrown some of the biggest curveballs at me this past year and the only thing keeping me sane is my ability to laugh at it all at this point
Extremely disappointed no one informed me of this group's existence https://t.co/1UBanz4Nke

@iamtony_97 No problem! I'd call and ask they might still accept you for testing due to the exposure. Hope you and your roommate stay healthy!
@iamtony_97 If you have symptoms you should be able to call Health Services and get tested! They're also offering voluntary testing to randomly selected students via email

Tell me why last night I had a dream that I had to sneak around some political office and save the democratic party from a giant robot thing and AOC, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer were in it
Not to be wholesome on the tl but I love hearing my roommates laughing together
This is insanity. They get inside of the Capitol while actively trying to stop a democratic process meanwhile people peacefully protesting against the loss of human life get tear gassed and shot at https://t.co/0QJxOqHoLp

Found out if you give a mouse a cookie you'll suddenly wake up to find it being eaten on your side table in the middle of the night causing you to yell "holy sh*t" while the mouse jumps away
