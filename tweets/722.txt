these the type of days i wish i had more than one friend bc how nice is this freaking weather let’s go outside😭
making jj confess her “feelings” for spence was the worst possible story line criminal minds has ever done 😭☠️   i love them as besties😭
real criminal minds fans only:   who do you hate more erin strauss or linda barnes &amp; why is it linda barnes?
grateful will never be a strong enough word.
it’s ironic (&amp; yet so beautiful) that in the toughest most soul shattering moments of my life, Jesus time &amp; time again proves He is the most faithful sustainer
i want jj to be my best friend
i’m obsessed bye😍😭 https://t.co/v0yBCXdrHl
y’all why daja tell me last week she thought ludacris was a christian rapper😭✋🏽
plus did i ever say anything about wanting chris??? bye😂
i get they loved each other &amp; i’m so sorry for them that it didn’t work out, but why as a black man do you not see why it was better for them to split????? that’s my concern.
clearly i was being sarcastic but ANYWAY not that im obligated to explain this to you, but idc what the heck he do. instead of playing the devils advocate/getting meaningful answers from them, he was asking matt why he felt like he couldn’t date her while she educated herself. https://t.co/Zd9CRVTgyj
&amp; emmanuel ocho or whoever the heck can go home too. they must’ve just picked the first black man they seen bc geez🤦🏽‍♀️ #TheBachelor
