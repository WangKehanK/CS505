I just wanna say that you guys are amazing! You have made my first year on Patreon absolutely magical. It's soooo nice to be in closer contact with my readers than before when I'd publish a book and pray someone would e-mail me with their thoughts. https://t.co/FNGg3mb81F https://t.co/99wJenDxDw
@RicksWriting "Censor hearts" seems like overkill to me. I think it's plenty SFW. The adult version of the cover, however, is one of my faves.
@crabbyraccoon @fekfekfekfek Love his expression!

@potpies I can't see a flower on its chest. I can only see a screaming monster mouth. https://t.co/lEmkMW314n
@Fossillus You're acting like I got all demanding. All I said was "Lions have round pupils."
@Fossillus Don't get all soapboxy. Some people don't realize and go around with accidentally inaccurate characters because no one took the moment to point out the error. I was only trying to help.
@GoldenDruid Lions have round pupils.
Not the actual porn, but a setup for some montrose porn next time on my Patreon: https://t.co/GLhP9EVF4U

@BearHybrid RAWR!
The cake is so delicate that it's easily damaged. It may not be beautiful, but I can't wait to put it in my mouth. https://t.co/cHuTPc3Pth

@AngryOpinicus @ArtOfAlexH You won't be disappointed!
@ArtOfAlexH "The Rhino and the Redbill" was every bit as wonderful as I could have hoped and more so. Great job and congrats on such an accomplishment! I could totally see playing that as a game (and that I'd suck at it)! Can't wait for your next Kickstarter! https://t.co/BY56JN1GfF
