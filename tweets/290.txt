@Luja234 @renegadecut @Yucantcontrolme @LackingSaint @biggestjoel the... the top 1%???? that is very unreasonable to believe, actually
@dangelno you are a full foot taller than me. unsubbed
not that anyone cares but i do have 5 boyfriends and one of my boyfriends has 2 more that i'm not dating and basically what i'm saying is eventually our polycule will reach every person in the world
@marysuewriter omg... my 13th birthday

@mothra777 @dangelno @ahgase_heart this is not happening, anywherw

@I0singface @Igbteddie bi men can say the f slur
@Drewbydrew_ @Herne @rltrdx mine has 2, but 1 stopped working about a month after i got it. either way 2 is definitely not enough
@RoonKolos @AlmostStace @IAmDragonellZ @slimyhipster so sorry, i'm sure this isn't your fault but i have no idea what you're trying to say
