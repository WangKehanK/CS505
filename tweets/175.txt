My brother rick rolled 100% of the viewers of the colonel awards and he deserves a cookie
Democrats are so bad at marketing they gave the average American family of four $5600 in stimulus checks alone but ppl still believe the TCJA was a better way to spend the exact same sum of money

I'm sure there are plenty of people who wished Reagan used the scores of billions he pumped into the military to, you know, manage the health crisis of his presidency. https://t.co/g5o6fwtTqa
can someone explain why the U.S can be the most impoverished, unhealthy, and dangerous developed nation in the world and somehow have over half it's population convinced it's the greatest in earth

Dems want to make it safer and easier to vote. Dems want to give people a higher minimum wage. Dems want to combat climate change.  The GQP wants to make abortion illegal and shutdown the federal government https://t.co/S3tRXnHOSb

@nytimes I hate him as much as anyone... But ask Al Franken about how resigning worked out.   If a fair investigation makes Cuomo look worse, fine. If it frees him, fine.  I believe his accuser's – but isn't it right to be sure?
republicans love the free market until the free market cancels them for being horrible people
@CNNPolitics Compare this to "I don't take responsibility at all" and tell me voting doesn't matter.
