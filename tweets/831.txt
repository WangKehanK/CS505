i of course don‚Äôt mind romance novels but expecting literary fiction to follow a romance novel format is ridiculous!!!

one teenage girl said once you can only take plan b every six months on tik tok and now i spend my days as an amateur emergency contraceptive expert telling teens it won‚Äôt kill them to take plan b frequently

apparently jenny mccarthy said with her whole chest tonight on the masked singer that mgk was from houston as if he has not created a whole personality out of being from cleveland ohio ü•¥
@kbaileyjava2 okay and to think before i saw this my biggest question was what compelled them to hire a 25 year old to play jem finch

@chriscjoseph i 100% understand. that being said, i never actually watched detective pikachu because we all have to draw the line somewhere and my somewhere is watching detective pikachu for chris geere
@chriscjoseph christine this tweet made me burst into laughter in a way i can‚Äôt explain
chris geere if you‚Äôre going to be on every tv show airing right now can you at least be on one i can actually tolerate watching? i feel like grey sloan memorial is always hiring more doctors.
chris geere is on this is us now!!! really making the tearjerker basic cable rounds!!!
