@latimes My son is a quarter black and has blonde hair and blue eyes. So that makes no sense that he can't play the grandfather of superman.
@JoeyRyanOnline But if you come out if all of this changed in any way. Can make peace with your accusers. Can dedicate yourself to being a better person who can be a positive influence on the world. I will gladly give you a second chance. But odds are you will squander that opportunity.
@JoeyRyanOnline And not a single one if your peers have spoken up in your defense? Your "wife" hasn't come to your defense. How many people have you sued? Any of them recant their accusations? Have you done anything to improve yourself beyond googling bible verses?
@JoeyRyanOnline You squandered your trust. You squandered your promotion. You squandered Your career. You squandered you marriage. Because you could never be satisfied. You had to have more. You became an addict. You thought you where above everyone else. Such a great Christian.
@WWEKarrionKross @FallAndPray_ @Lady_Scarlett13 How else can it go. https://t.co/4NJFnIgqGn
@JWrestlingV2 @iamjondraper He can't help himself. He gained power and let it turn him into what he is now. When pitty becomes your move with the opposite sex. When the perception is do what I want if you wanna make money is your move with the opposite sex.
@JoeyRyanOnline I was a big supporter of yours. You had every chance in your career but you became the guy who suplexed women by their chests. Flipped people with your dick. You just became a gimmick. You made unwanted groping a joke. You made being in "gay situations" a joke. Japan ended you.
@JoeyRyanOnline You where at one point in your career the best representation of LGBT/sexual positive. You meant something. Then you squandered it. You used depression and self pity make moves on women who where technically hired by you. You had a position of power and abused it.

@WWEKarrionKross @WWENXT When you know the right words to say you don't need much. https://t.co/ZS4E7askEr
@WWEKarrionKross Never understood the hammer into tire work out. Is it about your control after the strike or the lifting if the sledge to make a strike with the tire just being a safe thing to hit?
@iamjondraper I got DT to block me for giggles so yeah cool tweet lol.
@DickVanKlondike @WrestlingSoup Needs to be Braun with the Thomas face really.
@NylaRoseBeast The duality. Savage in the ring but Toru Yano outside the ring.
@girloncinema @AEW I remember when second from the left framed Roger Rabbit.
@WWEKarrionKross @RingsideC @Mattel I live with a walking breathing Chuckie Doll https://t.co/Fi4ifi1qHN
@madg27ny1 @TheLionelGreen @mcduff_daniel Seth isn't Puerto Rican his step father is. Seth is of middle eastern decent.
@VinnyBCT @blueblade664 @JDfromNY206 They all come back. Everyone has bills to pay or an ego to feed. The whole basis of the industry is never say never. Kid
@aewbotches @TonyKhan @luchasaurus @realmarkostunt @AEW If a guy gets paralyzed in this company they will thank the company for the opportunity and get paid enough to buy fancy chairs. If someone gets killed.... Their family will thank the company for letting their husband live their dreams and cash the checks.
@shellyknicksTV @Caleb_Mathis @MastaSnakCracka @ShaneHelmsCom He did F5 Gowen's leg into the post. Back in the day most of what Brock and Show did was Interchangeable...as well as Kurt. Like it was just rotating a storyline with three people almost doing the same thing with the same alliences.
@bertkreischer WhyÂ¿????????
@bertkreischer How......??
@JDfromNY206 @MrSoldier1HD https://t.co/4E6Z3DKXyz
@KevZCastle He was awesome in 7 Psychopaths. A must watch that doesn't make sense till the last 10 minutes.
@xShawnXphoenix Looks like they all huffed silver spray paint.
@NylaRoseBeast I prefer swearing for free paper.
@TheRealDisco My store at the Flamingo can't keep it in stock.
@screamqueendaff I just found out you were a child actor. How do you not have a top tier podcast? You are a person who knows where the bodies are burried.
@WWEKarrionKross @correctoroftime @Lady_Scarlett13 Can't wait for you to come back to Vegas. I missed every chance to see you and as soon as you hit NXT they stopped having shows here along with everyone else.
@iamjondraper AJ went from the powerplant to ROH and TNA.
@Maffewgregg Can't wait for them to start adding in martial art movie sounds effects whenever someone hit another person.
@vrijeray @AndradeElIdolo @s_d_naito He was lI before Naito. La Sombra Is The OG.
@iamjondraper @JaydeeTalks Tyson was reacting to Holyfield illegally headbutting him and not getting called on it.
@JDfromNY206 These idiots. Don't worry JD her account is taken off live so she can get rid or problematic tweets because she has signed to a new company.
@KevZCastle Naw Wardllow unexpectedly has the goods. He isn't even a bad talker but when your with MJF your allowed to be mute.
@WWERollins Thought you prefered Gingers...
@souIstyce Wish you could include Mystwalker tittles considering it was the creator of Ff running that studio.
@WWEGraves Shout out to Chris Issacs. https://t.co/X60t3sGnrZ
@KevZCastle @JamiePennycuic2 Can't remember if it is your brother @iamjondraper or Joey to blame bit when I hear her music I hear "dancing in a chair, dancing in a fucking chair".
@IAmJericho @RecordingAcad @eddievanhalen @RazzieAwards Can we get This man in AA? Or At leaste on the DDPY health regimen.
@DickVanKlondike Wasn't that her gimmick??
@IandrewDiceClay Mark Henry lived in his house. Odds are that is prob FreeBird merch or something from a historical match. Like God dam some of his shit is from the 80's and 70's where you had Lenard Skynard with the confederate flag as well as a band confederate railroad.
@Eman419Boyd @TheKurtAngler1 @mckenzieas93V2 You do know it is fake. And he is doing the same moves now. Except he is usually against people bigger than him.
@TheKurtAngler1 @mckenzieas93V2 I've been hit in a fight and honestly I thought I hit the other guy more but the security footage showed that I missed most my shots while he hit me. But the fact I tossed him down and hit him with a knee made up for it.
@TheKurtAngler1 @mckenzieas93V2 But he is actually being hit so sure he could be missing those shots and is why Finn wasn't selling them.
@JDfromNY206 The All star game crowd noise was much better than the live crowd. And enjoyed ain't no mountain high enough during a match.
@Patrick_W_Reed His career was lengthened by those matches. He was a technician in the ring but his body gave out. So he started a style that took a toll on his skin rather than his joints.
@iamjondraper Think they will take a while before they take another shot at him. Because exluding 20% of what he said about the female talent that have proven him right every time. Everyone he shits on botched within the past month.
@AEW @OfficialEGO @brlive @FiteTV Was Archer doing yoga? The perfect stillness of his dog pose is amazing.
@KevZCastle @JDfromNY206 Just wait until you see his stats in the video game they are making. Their new game is just an AEW skin on a ten year old casino game. That isn't making a game that is producing dlc for an old app game.
@iamjondraper Christian is the Lou Reed of wrestling..Sure the people in the industry love him but most casuals just like him.
@solomonster All these signings probably spells the end of the ride for a lot of unsigned talent on dark.
@iamjondraper Think coming to America 2 will have less people mindfucked than Wanda Vision.
@AskPapaJohns placed an order on the app only to find out somehow the app changed my address. Then after I fixed the problem the driver still went the the wrong address. Then I had to sit on my porch for 20 minutes to direct the deliverer to my house. Pizza was cold.
@AskPapaJohns Well first the app somehow changed my address since I last ordered. Then when I changed the address back to correct and reordered they still went to the wrong address then when the pizza finally showed up it was ice cold but the bbq chicken tenders where perfect.
@lilscrowlie I see you too have ordered Pizza on the Papa John's app.
@JDfromNY206 They finally asked who the fuck you were before we signed you..
Fuck Papa John's. The dumbest pizza place on the planet.
Second try they tell me nobody answered the door. I left the door open with the screen door shut. They tell me that they saw kids in the house and nobody answered their knocks. My nine year old yelled me nobody came to the house. My neighbors tell me nobody came to my house. WTF
@DaveAndMahoney Like honestly I dare you to google search mail order bride and post the first picture.
@DaveAndMahoney Yeah sure buddy.
@DaveAndMahoney That is the most generic mail order bride ever.
@SquareEnix @FinalFantasy 9
@JDfromNY206 When will they really push Cesaro? Even if it is just tossing him a cookie toss him a god damn cookie.
So today I got the fastest pizza order ever except they went to the wrong address. Then when I fixed the address on an app that has already delivered to my house, this is the longest I have ever waited for a pizza.
@IAmJohnKrauser Gotta update you picture on twitter dude. Did you lose 30lbs? Do we all need to go to your show so you can eat? Should we all be your grandma and feed you more?
@KevZCastle @solomonster AEW is focused on signing people for their video game.
@KevZCastle @solomonster Trust me it's Kurt. He has a podcast with Conrad.
@solomonster It's Kurt. Everyone that works with Conrad goes to AEW.
@Mimikapu21 @JDfromNY206 It's Kurt.
@JDfromNY206 The pattern is work with Conrad and go to AEW. So of course it is Kurt.
@JWrestlingV2 In Hollywood you can get sued. Which is why some productions work hard to do things to hide a star is pregnant. Like camera shots and use props cause a lot of people are working and can't loose money because someone important can't work.
@KevZCastle I walked out of Armageddon and walked into the theater with something about Mary and was so annoyed watching Burt Wonderstone brace that movie was just people showing how good they can act in a movie with no plot.
@TonyKhan @Wrestling4WC If Joey sues Tony I will laugh my ass off.
@MikeUnbanned 3 rules in life man #1 don't be a dick. #2 If you are not the messed up one in a relationship get out. #3 don't be a dick.
@IAmJohnKrauser @breaktheap Work your ass off and get a Vegas Gig dude. Break a leg.
@WWEKarrionKross I moved from Connecticut to Seattle and thank God I had a thick enough skin to thrive with the Cynical Seattle sense of humor where "Go F off" is a phrase of love.
@MintyRetroGames @JWrestlingV2 @TonyKhan @Wrestling4WC Thing about Joey was that everyone knew. But he was a potential booking for them on his show so they said nothing. Nobody defended his accusers.
@TheDrewYariShow Thing is NXTs audience isn't even watching on USA. The network and the 1hr hulu cut are where the viewers are. NXT on USA is just free money for the company.
@JDfromNY206 Shane was trying his hardest to not sound like Peter Griffin.
@KevZCastle @JDfromNY206 Brauns new character is that he is Ryback. Just comes across as dimwitted and entitled.
@solomonster As much as I don't wanna take advantage of something told to me In trust I feel you are a safe choice to share with. And as I said you have helped me through some bad times since 2012.
@solomonster Ps. Delete the last message don't wanna feel like I went against the trust of some people thanks Jason you helped me through hard times.
@Taeler_Hendrix Venture bros.
@SKDxkiller @NateBash450 @MTill24 @real1 But he was still hanging out at a crack den and banging a crackhead. Kinda a red flag.
@WrestlingSoup Just know that the show was signed for 10.
@WrestlingSoup But are still representations of real people. With Billy even wearing the Wiccan costume for halloween. Show is very trippy.
@WrestlingSoup Well her son Billy is brought from a future timeline to the current world. And her brother becomes not a mutant to be an inhuman. Honestly the whole of Wanda's existence is to go against Cannon.
@JDfromNY206 Someone probably snitched out your Jim Ross reddit post.
@ShaneHelmsCom Good thing they don't break when that happens. They had to make them detachable.
@AlejandroCasaas @WWECesaro Yes and just leave the company his so works at to have a Miro Run.
@solomonster He did jump before they all where looking at him had Drew on point watching while the others where kinda fighting.
@solomonster Yeah was thinking they hung around from the hurt business entrance.
This is the problem when you argue with a AEW incel https://t.co/WvUoeyRZ6Y
@SoDuTw @VRKurosawa @KennyOmegamanX @Mr_Hines82 Okay. Kid. Suck your house thumb. I am sorry for mistaking a child for an adult.
@SoDuTw @VRKurosawa @KennyOmegamanX @Mr_Hines82 Your a douche so block me you infant.
@SoDuTw @VRKurosawa @KennyOmegamanX @Mr_Hines82 Like let me explain to you. Kenny isn't reading your tweets. He doesn't care what you say about the product.
@SoDuTw @VRKurosawa @KennyOmegamanX @Mr_Hines82 Well yes Joshie is something that NJPW has nothing to do with?
@SoDuTw @VRKurosawa @KennyOmegamanX @Mr_Hines82 Word are words bud.
