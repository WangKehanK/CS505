@shaikhshack Brady is so good
They ordered a side of rubber bullets, this service is terrible https://t.co/a5cdncdl2m
@chayselblack This is hysterical
@Crawdawgx @RowdyHaack Damn it
@Crawdawgx @RowdyHaack I love that they won, keeping Herman isnt what UT needs to grow so the longer he can stay around the better
This ruined my Christmas https://t.co/4YyNtKu8LB

@casey_lerner @ginobilifor3 Bama wins by 30+ even without Waddle. Have fun getting blown out twice in a row kids
I hope Texas University wins their captain crunch cereal bowl, or whatever it is. Anything to make sure Herman stays
@wilsoncorey97 Eh, bowl game is predetermined and it is what it is. We’d blow out either one this year
@wilsoncorey97 And truly, assuming we would’ve been placed 4 and played Bama, this way looks better for recruiting.   Looking like we got hoed out of the CFP, and destroying UNC will be more appealing for recruits who want to win a natty than getting pumped by Bama again
I mean, we get to watch ND get dime pieced by by Bama, and we get to throttle a sub par team in the orange bowl
@lang_hunter Haven’t seen any arguments against this order that make any sense
1. Bama 2. Clemson 3. TAMU 4. OSU
Crazy frog in the top right just being nosy https://t.co/E9zDwYs6xx
@clauuud_ Literally every day
“If Florida and TAMU played 9 more times, Florida would win 9 times out of 10” yeah well, all you gotta do is lose once, maybe throw a shoe or two, and those other 9 games don’t matter
Baylor was a good enough game for OU https://t.co/MDhzVmJc3D
That’s fine because Clemson is taking it by 21+ https://t.co/bCq5JGMtia

Reminiscing to when a ton of petty Aggies were talking down  @TheKellenMond’s skill as a QB because he spoke up about racial injustice on campus.
