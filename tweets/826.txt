@short__hippie Thank you! I am too 😅
@short__hippie Yeah I’m okay now. The past week was pretty rough but luckily it’s gotten better.

Some good news:  Mercury will be out of retrograde in 2 days. 🙌🏻  That is all.
Would much rather be doing anything else OTHER THAN listening to a video about comic sans and why it’s the worst font
@leannnn_rose Cute lil bump! 🖤
