In the beginning of this semester I was sad that it is gonna be my last.  Now I can’t wait to get the FUCK out of here and graduate🎓
There's something so embarrassing about walking around campus with your bag open 😅
Okay but how cute is my nephew? 🥺🥰 https://t.co/hSS03sGvJ9
My mom really is my best friend
Getting paid on Black Friday is so dangerous https://t.co/iABMoD9HLD
@Carley_Happel12 And they say love is dead😂
I'm at Target and I am passing this husband and wife looking at matching pajamas  Wife- "what do you think?"  Husband- "I think I'm never bringing you back here again."
HANDS DOWN the best Halloween Song🧟‍♂️👻🎃 https://t.co/iJ2BPGajbC
Sometimes I think I am a responsible adult but then I do shit like lock my keys in my house, then I'm reminded that I am a dumbass
Having a job that you ACTUALLY enjoy and look forward to is such a blessing😌
@devonwells_ @_UNISecrets Fuck yeah I do. Who wants to see 12 toes? DM me
Honestly old white men should not be in office and have control over this country.
Me?? Save?? Money?? https://t.co/NumwEUy5xy
Throwback to 2016 when I got a whole ass party to do this (besides @Mhadeesun) can we bring this back to save 2020? #MannequinChallenge https://t.co/UvgKwccyVH

You ever see your friends younger siblings grow up and just feel old as hell?! Like you're supposed to stay 12 forever
Trying to put on a sports bra after a shower is a workout in itself. https://t.co/N758UARbRv

@CollinConger What a steal
@CollinConger All my monies. So like $200
@CollinConger I’ll pay you to come to my house and bring me power 😅
Having a boyfriend who can talk in different accents is great until I'm speaking to a Russian mafia member for over an hour. 🙄
Never forget when I was in American Eagle and a worker approached me and I thought she was going to say "how are you?" But she said "hello" and I mixed up "good" and "hey" with "GAH" she looked at me and I just kept walking right out of the store.
@hailsschulmeis I’ve given up on that cause there’s no hope for me. I need someone to literally yell at me for me to hear what they are saying  😂
*laughs* “wow” “That’s true” “Oh yeah” “Mmhmm”  Me pretending to understand what you said because I am deaf.
@Brianna_Stone_ Sandy cheeks 👀
Okay, I'm ready for fall and leggings and sweatshirt weather🥵
I can't believe water beds were actually a thing. And why did I want one for so long? 😭
@Brianna_Stone_  is really popping off and I am LIVING for it! 👸🏼😍
If I say “let’s go get margs” do you know what I’m saying
2000's music will NEVER get old 🎶
@CollinConger Did what? Tell the group
Gonna be honest, back when I was young and innocent I had no idea what they were doing when they would sit around the table 😂 https://t.co/pYMbJVoO93
It’s honestly ridiculous how men don’t have to go through periods and then think we’re being dramatic. Like bitch touch me again and I’ll claw out your eyes.
@Carley_Happel12 What can I say Eminem is the greatest 😉😂
When the fuck is the sun gonna come out???
I honestly feel so bad for my bf cause I be telling stories at least 3-4 times 😂
I miss the bars but my bank account does not.
God damnnn I want some sushi😩
Just got asked if I was sad that I couldn’t go to high school for the rest of the year 😅
@hailsschulmeis I can't fucking wait🙌🏼
This is perfect darty weather :/
Here is a video of my cat to cheer you up https://t.co/3WXGudTuGl
Milk with Hershey's syrup is always a slap 👅
Told Jake that I love Rihanna and her songs and he added some of my favorites to his Spotify and knows the lyrics and plays them when I’m with him💕
Dating your best friend really is the greatest🥰
You know it's gonna be a good day when you wake up and you're still drunk
@CollinConger Someday my child
Gonna be honest, sometimes I forget that I’m 21 and can legally buy alcohol without having to be paranoid😅
@LaurenFink1 You would have made over $100 today cause I'm a POS who can't focus 😂
@LaurenFink1 I'm poor but willing to pay $7 for every slap😂
Will hire someone to slap me every time I get distracted while trying to study. Been at it for 2 hours and haven't accomplished anything😅
When you told yourself you're only gonna drink half a bottle of wine, but drink the whole damn thing. https://t.co/LNJvwZA7iE
@hailsschulmeis Looks like we've grown up so much🥂😂
Couple months ago a worker at Village Inn said that I "have such a wonderful bubbly smile" and I think about that very often. It doesn't take much to be nice to someone and I guarantee they will never forget it. ☺️
@McKennaaMariee Yeah I didn't get lucky and have hypothyroidism and it fucking sucks😂
@Chelseabreahnn You do
Literally have no motivation to do any class work or study. Pls help.
Happy 21st bday to this bitch! The day has finally came where you can use your actual ID 😉 can't wait to celebrate with you bb ❤️ @Mhadeesun https://t.co/pYNTfM8aLs
Drunk Jenna is way too generous and can't be trusted with my debit card.
@CollinConger @flemister222 Awe glad I'm included in this🥰
@abgburt @MeekMobley @CollinConger why can I see you doing this
Why do I drink so much????
In the middle of a party my boyfriend called me up and sang "one man band" to me in front of everyone🥰
Worked 9 hours then drove 2 hours home and walked into my room to this. He completely surprised me with a dozen roses and is spending the day with me❤️ it feels so good to be treated right🥰 https://t.co/7SmZNFO2Xb
Car got broken into and they took some random things but left my teriyaki beef jerky. Rookie thiefs.
21 years old and my mom gave me a bath last night.
Literally just begged the bartender to check my ID after the whole day of not getting checked😂
@MeekMobley Well I just ordered my first legal drink and didn't get ID'd :/

In 1st grade I forged my moms signature and the teacher caught me and made me stay in recess and write my name 100 times :/ https://t.co/sWHrIbA2wH
