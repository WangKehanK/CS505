Morning after my first #COVID19Vaccine and my injection site is sore (3/10 pain) and my joints are a bit achy, but other than that I feel fine! #WorthIt
One hour since my shot, and the only thing I’ve noticed was 5 seconds of mild dizziness when I got out of the car #WorthIt #pfizer
20 minutes post-shot and no side effects - i was so brave! #WorthIt https://t.co/IFK4O3rM6u
I spent 80 minutes in line - but everyone behaved themselves and the staff are so professional and so nice! #worthit
Today I get my first COVID-19 shot! I drove an hour to Chicago Heights b/c that was the most convenient location with appointments on my days off #worthit

Grandma had an appointment to get the vaccine and didn’t go. Now she’s gone. Get the fucking vaccine.
