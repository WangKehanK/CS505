Trying to mentally prepare myself for this work day 😅
I just excitedly told my grandma that I have an ID so I can now go buy her beers
My grandma always knows the right thing to say
There are so many things I wish I could change about myself
I can’t concentrate
Man do I miss my dad

Holding back tears at work is so hard
My stomach is in knots right now

Life’s unfair , you should be here 😣

Keep God first ☝🏽
If I had 10k I would immediately move back home 🥲 I miss my family
