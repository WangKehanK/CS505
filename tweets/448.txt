Wish I wasn’t spending my summer studying and sitting in zoom lecture every minute. But it’ll all be worth it in the end... right?
Just finished my 7th book of quarantine 📚
Pretty sad knowing I won’t compete in another steeplechase race 😢
Don’t even know what’s real anymore.
If you feel guilty for an action, then chances are you are guilty.
Really sick of bugs.. opened my car door earlier &amp; was instantly attacked by a swarm of horse flies that invaded my car &amp; wouldn’t get out 🙄
Had a rough start to my morning... I overslept and was 15 minutes late to work today 😂 #tootired
@allyknepp I still think you’re cool 😛
Interview season for pa programs has begun 😬🙃
Anyone want to finish writing my paper for me...?         No?  Yeah me either 🙄
That weird moment when you just saw an Amish man either smoking or vaping. ....Like what?
Literally hate aggressive drivers.. they cause me the most stress and bring out the bad in me 😠
Whenever you order a medium iced coffee but they accidentally give you a large. 😏 good start to the #newyear so far
@cadie_k Same girl... currently watching it lol

You know you ran long when you pass the same car twice over an hour later.
Sneezing while running is probably the worst thing ever
You ever love something so much, but it also causes you so much pain..?
Man have I missed evenings sitting on the porch reading a book 📖
The summer workouts can't come out any sooner.. #dyingtorun
@Vanderhoff2 Good one
