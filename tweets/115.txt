@cuddlepunk_1 i forgive you ❤️
i can’t believe i have to say this but being vaccinated does NOT mean you can invite yourself and your six best friends to your estranged aunt’s house in the country and get picked off one-by-one by a ghost-cat just so you can reconnect with your dead mother 🙄🙄🙄

@unoficialmomdad exactly!! lately ive resorted to productivity as my social life has all but disintegrated and i have gotten some (personal film project) things done, but it’s a very very rare scenario for me
just something i noticed.   anyone else feel the same?
i feel like the only way i learn, is by rule breaking &amp; taking on more than i am equipped to.  it forces me to be adaptable and allows me to develop skills at a fast pace.   those things don’t happen for me when i follow the rules or go step-by-step
