@ZoeQuotes13 I saw that 🙄 how embarrassing
@aleegatorrr The ring looks so shiny 😍
@manthapaige13 @taylorswift13 I’m ready for it release it already please
@sarahakhtar_ Same here
@scubydubyduu Honestly same 😂
@scubydubyduu Right? It sounds so familiar yet so different? But I know all the words? It feels like coming home
@manthapaige13 It’s so good
I’m obsessed with the re release of Fearless it sounds like 2008? But also like 2021?
@sarita_ysabella So glad you both are safe 💕
@UnicornSamuel Honestly one note in and I was crying and then fifteen hit
@UnicornSamuel I’m dead I’ve already cried
@anadaze_ I’m already crying
@AgsREACH @muahnaat Honestly they should qualify it’s ridiculous they have been working hard the whole pandemic
@calumariah Hopefully it’s ok and doesn’t get a lot of damage
@calumariah Honestly Walmart is probably safe there aren’t a lot of windows
If you’re in CSTAT or Bryan please stay safe 💕
Everyone in CSTAT is talking about the hail and lightning and I’m in Austin missing it all 😭
@lilac_arbor Ok cool cool I’ll have to look into it. I’m going to law school so I wanna take advantage of the student discount cause you get Hulu but if it’s too much of a pain I’ll just get a family plan with my mom 😭
@lilac_arbor Dang :/ is there a way to easily transfer all your playlists over or no?
@sophiasigh Congrats 🥳💕
This is such a good idea. This would’ve saved me many bus rides to and from HEB my freshman year. Many people don’t bring cars and this is genius. https://t.co/05clf4WD7H
@kekethekhaleesi Yet he claims to be pro life 🙄
@JohnMA_24 Can’t they wait til summer? 😭
@sarahakhtar_ @taylornation13 @evermorebot @Houdini_17 @dumbbitchhrs_69 Hell yeah
@youremyloverr @taylorswift13 Same 😭
@aggieachieve The Aggie ring! My ring day was one of my fav days at the university
Apartment hunting is exhausting I keep taking ones I don't like off my list and then somehow I keep adding more 😭😭
@katiebhabie alright i had to double check to make sure but i wasn't following him thank goodness
I love seeing everyone get their ring. It's so exciting and I know everyone worked so hard. congrats to everyone and please keep posting your pics!
@code_cherry Congrats 🥳💕
@sarahakhtar_ I’m having a breakdown just thinking about it
@aleegatorrr Ahh yes girl 💕 congrats! 🥳
@Astro_Aggie15 Yes if you’re over 16. For kids under 16, just a negative test since they can’t get it yet.
@CatFan97 I had to do it yesterday I’m angry
@jm_wooten So proud 💕
@CatFan97 YES OMG
@maisie_boehmer I have no idea I’m trying to catch up
@aleegatorrr No girl you can’t over share it’s your ring day- celebrate it! You’ve worked so hard- I’ll be hyping up every single pic 💕
Guess who got more squishmallows 😍
@alainakings But also that’s ridiculous tbh it makes it horrible for actual fans
@alainakings See that’s why a lot of places are setting limits
@alainakings It’s insane I’ve seen people sell them for hundreds of dollars
@Makingitup3 Congrats girl 🥳💕
@manthapaige13 Honestly same even though I’m not a cardholder I’m sure all of us will end up with whatever it is
@manthapaige13 Same I’m gonna get one 😂
Congrats to everyone who got their rings today and everyone who is getting their rings this week- enjoy the day! You’ve earned it 🥳
@aleegatorrr Dip nails are superior tbh they helped my nails so much if I had $ I would keep getting them done. I got mine longer than I liked for ring day though 😅
@taylorswift13 EXCUSE ME. it's 8AM- a new song?  so so ready for Fearless on Friday
@sarahakhtar_ @The713sniper Same 😭 I lived on Starbucks and Mac and cheese
@hayesswift_ Oh definitely! I feel like it’s definitely something you should do unless you have a good reaosn not to- especially in your job. In retail and food jobs as well.
@hayesswift_ I agree unless the job is so toxic you have to quit immediately (only happened once and that’s a whole story- I did give two weeks but then it got worse and I had to leave )
@youremyloverr @taylorswift13 So pretty 💕
@The713sniper Paying full price for housing and dining yet we had to walk clear across campus to eat...we are elite
@AverySwift13 Yes!
@manthapaige13 i saw that...imagine ruining your whole vacation because you didn't want the temp check that you were informed about when you booked your trip....one of the reasons I'm holding off from visiting right now is cause i don't feel like dealing with stupid guests who don't listen
@freckled_frack i did that once and they made my life hell- giving me more work and creating all these outrageous deadlines for only me....worked my last scheduled shift that night (didn't want to screw my coworkers over) and quit the next morning
@manthapaige13 and i know guests are gonna take advantage of the new rule so this sucks for cast members
@BrookeRogers97 oh i can already see it happening....it's gonna be a mess
@sincerelyivy i'm kinda sad i mean i wasn't planning on going anytime soon but am going to Cali in the summer to visit family now that everyone i know is fully vaccinated and would love to go to disney
@manthapaige13 they should wait til the summer once more people are vaccinated
@BrookeRogers97 also it's Florida who has like no rules anymore so i'm not shocked
@BrookeRogers97 i'm assuming because enough people complained and maybe cause more people are getting vaccinated? Honestly I can see removing it if you're alone and want a quick pic but other than that keep it on it's not hard
@JohnMA_24 The Apple Watch battery is not the best but I love everything else
@vannah_richie @bigkittenqueen I think we did something similar? Like duh if you eat McDonalds all day everyday and don’t workout of course you’ll be unhealthy and will gain weight?
@bigkittenqueen And the fact that I watched it in health class? Wtf?
@goldrushmere that's the problem with any job they all want like 5 years of experience but will not even pay you a living wage so like? and they all claim to be entry level so like??
@Monicky8 Girl I will teach you timber let me see if I have my cotton eye Joe notes from my country western dance class
@scubydubyduu Proud of you 💕
@mbkar911 So exciting! Congrats!!
@tanner_biggs1 Personally if you can afford it stay the spring or take that one class in the spring (if it’s your last semester you can drop below full time hours and you can still keep any financial aid- I took 9 hours my last semester)
@aviiianab Yes! They care a lot about scores and GPA but a good personal statement and resume help too
@skinny_que Once you use this you can’t go back to regular soap
Almost bought the script hoodie but then I remembered I’ve had one for like two years 😂 but the white one does look nice
@snarkeigh The Texas A&amp;M sweatshirt 😍
