@missvers4ce Wow not even a subtle flex üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Next lego project - set #4504 Millennium Falcon. Had the set mostly together years ago but it has since disappeared into the void. Found 3/4 of the set on Mercari, hoping to fill in the blanks with what i'm able to dig up.  Still have no idea where im gonna put it though. https://t.co/vpQpvd3hWe
@Trickstersquill Hahahahahaha the accuracy

@livingcardsmtg I got mine through walmart - change your time zone to eastern on your computer then go to walmarts website at 11 and there should be a ton of appointments 5 days to a week out all around the cities &amp; suburbs.
@kelseypierson11 Well i dont respect a sleep schedule or my body so that helps a lot

@DinosaurDon94 Temuera loves star wars more than anyone idk what people are talking about
Got my clubhouse - invite lets see if the country club of social media is worth the hype. Full review on my IG to follow.
I think my favorite random fact is that Cher was the first recorded music artist to use autotune.
Got the grill set up just in time for summer. Truly embracing the homeowner title this week.
Peep that cartooney ass villain at the end but i‚Äôm all for it. Movie looks sick. https://t.co/E10UutOr8M
If anyone tells you that the burbs are quiet and unexciting - I saw a guy on a bike wielding a pirate sword.
@Trickstersquill You gotta rewatch the last scene man.
@Trickstersquill The tail ate people tho!
@Trickstersquill Thats literally the tail
Ya‚Äôll seen snowpiercer? Musk about to use that train of his as an ark for humanity smh. https://t.co/1zInBTxBl5
Remember 30 years ago every kid wanted to be a rockstar and all the boomers were calling it the downfall of society? Chill. https://t.co/1p1FHeMA9z
Someone on Tik Tok said that Joe Rogan is the male version of Gwyneth Paltrow and honestly I see it.
Black Widow been ready for over a year - just surprise me and take my $30.

Escape from New York is iconic as hell. Look at that eyepatch! https://t.co/pDaV7GtD2O
Winter solider Civil War First Avenger  I know civil war is basically avengers 2.5 but I‚Äôm into it. https://t.co/kzqSnfY2uM
Aight Snyder Cut was pretty good. Not groundbreaking by any means, but it certainly didn't feel like a 4 hour movie. Some pretty neat cameos and solid action sequences make it bearable. Solid 7/10. https://t.co/UwAAhxxcqi
Strapping in for the #SnyderCut
Aight pumped for this. Episode 1 was lit. https://t.co/GHhb1fQDim
@Devy_Kane Thor 3 is pretty much a reskinned guardians IMO. But definetly the best of the thor saga by a mile. Thor 2 trash.
@Trickstersquill Nah Wolverine is definitely one of those blue collar socialists.
@Devy_Kane I agree with you GOTG2 placement I think that part of the MCU is overhyped tbh. Looking forward to your thoughts on Infinity War/Endgame
When the stimmy hit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@Devy_Kane Top 5 marvel movie
Mom got the first round of moderna today so things are looking up for the Kleckner household vaccine-wise.
@MrLegenDarius Eeeee I got physcially ill watching this. Dude aint funny and his goonies are wack.
"I am a man of fortune and I must seek my fortune" - Henry Avery.
Pumped to see flying robot wing man and 100 y/o robot arm man fight a dude in Barney the Dinosaur cosplay on Friday. #FalconAndWinterSoldier
This belongs in a museum. A true relic from the early COVID days. https://t.co/Khw8wcdEIE
@Trickstersquill @MisterRudeman I mean where is the lie tho
@levinee28 https://t.co/BXHQkaF1XC
@levinee28 Are we fighting now
@levinee28 I literally said this was going to upset people
@Trickstersquill Wow
This is gonna upset a lot of people - but Harry Potter can go. Game of Thrones &amp; Star Wars have a great universes that are explored poorly and DC kills the animated movie/tv series arena. https://t.co/oGdT1mxSAm
Its been a year ya'll idk how you can keep up that anti-mask energy anymore.
Cheerios is the easy pick here but between Loops, Crunch and Flakes? Loops gotta go - Toucan Sam aint it chief https://t.co/sdzHlbOov0
We‚Äôre back to ‚Äúdamn I cant wait to go to LA again even though I complain about it all the time‚Äù part of quarantine again.

Im going home next weekend to drop off my tax paperwork and pick-up all my legos and tbh I'm REALLY excited to get this one back together more than anything else.  Fricken love Boba Fett. https://t.co/8HfBEday6D
@levi_mccormick Is my degree attached to my SSN? I was under the impression that a background check was to make sure my home address was legit and im not a felon
@EPithan94 At that point it really depends on what youre trying to do I guess.
@EPithan94 Right! Thats what im saying. But can you lie in a job interview? Theres no way for an employer to check.
Unless theres some super secret education check software/database that im not aware off that HR or recruiting agencies use - feel free to correct me.
I realized today that in my job hunting experience - no employer has ever asked for proof of education. Like im pretty sure you can put down whatever you want as long as its reasonable and nobody will question it.
Update still for sale. Turns out the interior is less than desirable. https://t.co/EMstYlLHfk
Yes because enlistment into the armed forces can be traced back to Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Ant Man. https://t.co/oayuciLQP5
@missvers4ce Thanks! They came with the house!
I got a doorframe chin-up bar and my 69 year old dad strolled in and cleared 3 in a row like a champ. Proud of him. https://t.co/UiLCVFJ6NS
Aight #WandaVision ended the best it could but lots of people on tik tok are gonna be disappointed.
Im renting a theatre idgaf https://t.co/6uNDL3jvgC
House across the street from me went up for sale - how long do you think itll stay on the market?
Over 10 years later and it still holds up https://t.co/vwnhnwPWao
The series ended with Supa Hot facing against himself in a high budget production. Great end to the series.
The series went on to attract the attention of internet allstars including @TimothyDeLaG, @souljaboy, and @chrisrock.
The genius of having a mute rapper in the second episode is honestly underratted
It chronicled a series of rap battles where the main character Supa Hot Fire aka glasses jacket shirt man as he faced against some of the best rappers in the game
Peak internet humor to me are the Rap Battle Parodies that came out when I was in high school. Source of a ton of great memes and iconic lines https://t.co/r4Sdfgvvy6
@The_Barftender Edina circa 2013 no cap

@Trickstersquill @charlesfare @KathrynnTheRed Linkedin trash ngl
@HobbesQ Static Shock had the best Batman/Justice League crossover episodes.
Newest episode of #WandaVision does what any penultimate episode of a season should do - give the audience a recap while filling in some plot holes before diving into the final moments. Boring yes - but i'm looking forward to putting down all theories that are flooding my FYP
As a Minnesotan I should really care more but I dont https://t.co/zvExYwhkzU

Im learning about Boolean Searches for my new job and all I can think about is @scryfall &amp; me searching for bad commander cards.
